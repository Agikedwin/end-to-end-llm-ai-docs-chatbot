The clinic was the result of a nationally renowned low-cost antiretroviral (ARV) program which Coptic Mission has pioneered in 2002.\\n\\nThe Hope Clinic, as it was then known, was staffed by a team of four people, operated out of three offices and treated approximately five patients every day. By December 2004, the Hope Center had expanded into what it is today – a fully comprehensive and free HAART treatment facility. The Hope Center now manages medical care for over 25,000 clients, with over 16,000 on ARVs across Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania.\\n\\nTreatment Literacy Program\\n\\nIn order to bring the services of the Hope Center outside the walls of the clinics, the mission launched the Treatment Literacy Program, an AIDS community treatment literacy program. The program goes beyond the traditional awareness campaigns, to an active program aimed at fighting AIDS-related stigmas by providing real options for life.\\n\\nIn Nairobi’s industrial area, where the Hope Center is the only comprehensive AIDS/HIV clinic, the staff has already provided one day training, and Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) to over 800 workers from the factories. • In Maseno, a rural village in western Kenya, the center has provided training to teachers and students in over 100 schools. Also, recognizing that community leaders hold the key to changing public perception of HIV/AIDS, the center has trained over 200 local chiefs and pastors. • In Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, the center has trained over 1000 church leaders and over 400 school teachers resulting in a newly trained group of adult leaders eager to learn more, and implement what they have learned.\\n\\nChildren and HIV/AIDS\\n\\nThe center’s pediatric programs in Kenya and Zambia are designed to manage HIV/AIDS in children, and are run by pediatric specialists with experience in all disciplines, in order to cater to children-specific medical and psycho-social needs. The pediatric clinics are the only ones of their kind. In addition to medical care, the program implements a home tracer and care program, which assesses the child’s household stability, and the ability of the caregivers to provide for all the child’s needs.\\n\\nWomen and HIV/AIDS\\n\\nIn Africa, women are often the main household providers. Coptic Mission is committed to empowering women, who are particularly vulnerable to infection. To do this, the mission has developed a number of female-focused initiatives that aim to facilitate change in cultural perceptions that have historically limited their opportunities. By teaching women how to deliver home-based care, by training them to become HIV/AIDS community educators and by equipping them with the tools to deliver these community health services, Coptic Mission has witnessed the transformed image that women carry in their communities. Evidence has shown time and again that healthier, stronger women and mothers result in healthier, stronger families and ultimately healthier, stronger communities.\\n\\nIn many of the rural communities in Kenya, Zambia and the Congo, the mission has also established income-generating activities for women to be more empowered economically so that their livelihood will not be dependent on potentially unhealthy demands and/or conditions of the partners. Coptic Mission is committed to enabling the women of Africa fulfill their God-given potential.\\n\\n©2023 Coptic Mission\"),\n",

The majority of the population, however, still does not have access to these facilities and there continues to be a great need for health care in small villages and rural areas. By the grace of God, Coptic Mission has started opening clinics in rural areas to treat the sick who are physically or financially unable to travel to the larger cities for medical attention. The focus is never just on urgent medical care, but also on outreach with compassion.\\n\\nCoptic Hospital – Maseno, Kenya\\n\\ncoptic\\n\\nThe first rural clinic established by Coptic Mission was the Coptic Hospital, established in Maseno (western Kenya) in 2004. It was very difficult at first, trying to recruit doctors and pharmacists willing to live in and work in such a rural area, but with time and God’s grace, the clinic has gradually grown and today boasts a number of full time staff: three doctors, two pharmacists, a physiotherapist and several nurses and lab technicians.\\n\\nThe clinic also now has an inpatient ward for patients who need close, around-the-clock monitoring and offers the following services: • Clinical consultations • Full pharmaceutical services • Basic laboratory testing • Inpatient services • Minor surgeries • Rehabilitation services • Free immunizations • Free family planning services • Free TB testing and treatment • Free STI testing and treatment • Free malaria treatment • Maternity ward • Ambulance service in order to reach out to more than just the people who come to the Coptic Hospital, the clinic staff conducts medical campaigns targeting the poorer, rural communities surrounding Maseno.\\n\\nThese campaigns provide basic medical care, medication, public health education and HIV testing. While the medical professionals treat the physical ailments, others are on hand to share the gospel and guide people to Christ, the ultimate Physician.\\n\\nCoptic Hospital – Musoma, Tanzania\\n\\ncc\\n\\nCoptic Hospital – Musoma, Tanzania Coptic Mission has had a presence in Musoma, Tanzania since the early 1990’s. For many years the mission was conducting medical campaigns and reaching out to the community in different ways but the need for a medical health center was clear. God opened that door in December 2007 when the mission established an outpatient clinic and medicine dispensary.\\n\\nLater that same year the mission, through funding from Center for Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), added the HIV comprehensive care clinic that offers free HIV care to the community. Since then the mission has provided medical services to approximately 26,000 outpatients and enrolled over 2,450 HIV clients into the HIV clinic. The medical center’s HIV services include HIV testing and counseling, TB clinic, outreach services, laboratory, inpatient care and pharmacy which provides antiretroviral drugs, opportunistic infection medications as well as counseling. Additionally, the center offers consultation, a fully equipped laboratory, a well stocked pharmacy, inpatient care and an operating room.\\n\\nAll the services are offered at affordable prices, so as to take into consideration the poverty in the village. We are looking to expand and need your prayers as we’d like to add an X-ray machine, and a mother and child clinic that would offer vaccinations and a blood bank. Coptic Mobile Clinics – Kanyama, Zambia and Mongoolee, Zambia Many of the people living in rural Zambia suffering from severe sicknesses, such as HIV/AIDS, have no access to any kind of medical attention.\\n\\nThe clinics established by Coptic Mission provide subsidized or free medication, lab tests and operations based on need. Furthermore, the clinics address basic public health issues through community education programs, increasing awareness on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, malaria, typhoid and other common and treatable but often deadly diseases. Located in the heart of the Zambian bush, the village of Mongoolee is hundreds of kilometers away from any medical attention. A very clear need for physical and spiritual healing prompted Coptic Mission to step in and provide a mobile clinic that provides services to the villagers once a month.\\n\\nThese services include free doctor consultations, free treatment, free medication and Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS. More critical cases are taken to the Coptic Hospital in Lusaka for treatment.\\n\\n©2023 Coptic Mission'),\n",

As a result, most of these teens are more vulnerable to risky sexual behavior, and ultimately to contracting HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The School Fees Program was created in 2000 to allow the parents/caregivers to remain engaged in the education of their children, while providing the necessary support and assistance. The students who receive the assistance are nominated by the priests and the committee in each church, and are selected based on a number of factors including financial need, active membership in the church, ability to maintain good grades and good behavior in school.\\n\\nAll the students sponsored by the program are mentored by servants in the church who follow up with them on progress at school, emotional needs and spiritual needs. The students also participate in a monthly spiritual day, which is an opportunity to continue to grow in their faith, and become more connected to the church community.\\n\\nSports Outreach\\n\\ng\\n\\nDaily faced by the ugliness and the tragedy that is the AIDS epidemic, a group of servants got down on their knees and cried out to the Lord. They needed to find a way to face the calamity head on. Soon the Lord began to reveal certain realities to them. They began to observe that people in rural areas had very few options when they had time on their hands, nothing to meet their social needs and as a result they gave into temptation. This time resulted from unemployment, dropping out of school or simply too much spare time during the school holidays.\\n\\nSoccer, or as it is better known in Africa, football, is extremely popular but many of the boys can hardly even afford a real ball. Instead, they use balls made of rolled up trash and they play barefoot on rocky fields, resulting in a number of injuries. As the servants continued to pray for a solution, they came up with an idea for a sports ministry and soon they began organizing a soccer tournament.

PEPFAR is partnering with the international community to accelerate \\ntowards the UNAIDS 95-95-95 global goals: 95 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status, 95 \\npercent of people who know their HIV status are accessing treatment, and 95 percent of people on treatment \\nhave suppressed viral loads. Progress towards epidemic control will be successfully measured, in part, through \\nan effective strategic information framework that not only monitors program outputs, but also key outcomes and \\nprogrammatic impact.  \\n \\nUNAIDS data shows that many PEPFAR countries have successfully reduced HIV incidence and are at or near \\nepidemic control. (Refer to the latest COP Guidance for information on progress towards epidemic control by \\ncountry.) As countries reach and maintain epidemic control, the program monitoring approach will shift to focus \\non case surveillance and examining viral load suppression gaps to improve programmatic implementation for \\nspecific populations not yet at 95-95-95.  \\n \\nFigure 1: PEPFAR Monitoring: Getting from Process to Impact \\n \\n \\n \\nGiven the global HIV progress over the past decade, planning, monitoring, and resource allocation must occur at \\nthe subnational, community, and site levels in order to achieve the greatest impact. Collection and use of \\ndisaggregated data that characterizes the populations (e.g., age, sex, key or priority populations, etc.) served in \\nthe lowest geographic areas where HIV services are being provided is critical in understanding current program \\nperformance and planning for future performance. Overlaying that data with the partners that are supporting the \\nimplementation of HIV services can also help us to understand the fidelity with which programmatic interventions \\nare being taken to scale within those specific populations and geographic regions. \\n \\nThe objectives of the MER guidance document are to streamline and prioritize indicators for PEPFAR programs; \\nhowever, MER indicators are not an exhaustive list of all metrics that should be monitored by PEPFAR \\nprograms and host country government. PEPFAR programs should continually monitor and assess any acute \\nprogrammatic issues and collect additional data to inform program improvement.  \\n \\nPEPFAR reviews MER indicators on an annual basis to ensure: \\n• indicators align with the programs planned for implementation and the expectations for both program \\nmonitoring and partner management practices;  \\n• indicators reflect any new PEPFAR initiatives and/or emerging programmatic areas; \\n• indicators align with multilaterals and partner governments to avoid duplication of data collection, where \\npossible;  \\n• continuous alignment within PEPFAR data streams (e.g., SIMS, expenditure reporting, SID etc.).; \\n• that redundancies are reduced between indicators; and \\n• that the MER guidance and training materials reinforce the relationships within and between indicators;  \\n \\nGranular aggregate data has been a powerful tool to monitor and manage the progress of programs in reaching \\nepidemic control. As countries continue to reach and maintain epidemic control, there is a need for individual \\nlevel data systems to address the remaining gaps among specific populations (e.g. 15-25 year-olds, key \\npopulations). Discussions with PEPFAR staff and external stakeholders, as well as feedback submitted through \\nthe MER Refresh survey, highlight a need for information based off of electronic individual-level data systems. \\nIndividual-level data can track clients across the clinical cascade and is nimble to evolving programmatic\"),\n",

Country programs and governments should continue to work to develop individual-level EMR, \\nlaboratory, surveillance, and other data systems that can monitor patient outcomes in conjunction with other \\ndisease areas, especially as the HIV cohort continues to age. The following indicator requests submitted through \\nthe MER Refresh survey are examples of critical information needs that could be answered using individual level \\ndata. This information will not be collected through MER this year, but countries should prepare to report on it in \\nthe future by utilizing individual level data systems: \\n \\n• Number of TB clients with a recent negative HIV status \\n• Number of clients with a reactive self-test that received a confirmatory test, as well as test result \\n• Number of ART clients on specific TPT regimens, including 1HP and 3HP \\n• ARV clients receiving multi-month dispensation by fine age \\n• Viral load coverage and suppression among pregnant and breastfeeding women by age \\n \\nStrong surveillance systems are a critical component of a sustainable health systems infrastructure. This has \\nbeen further illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Health infrastructure, laboratory systems, and surveillance \\nsystems developed for HIV have been utilized in the COVID-19 response, with HIV and COVID-19 data \\nreviewed together. Additionally, individual-level data systems will be integral in determining gaps across the \\nclinical cascade that developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Per the 2017 WHO \\nConsolidated Guidelines on Person-Centered HIV Patient Monitoring and Case Surveillance, person-centered \\nmonitoring refers to a shift from monitoring measuring services (e.g., the number of HIV tests or people on \\ntreatment) to monitoring people at the center of their \\naccess to linked HIV and health services. In \\nessence, this marks a shift to better support the \\nclients accessing services by focusing more on their \\nindividual health outcomes. \\nPEPFAR’s commitment to person-centered \\nmonitoring is evidenced throughout this guidance \\ndocument through: \\n• Indicators (i.e., HTS_RECENT) that allow \\nprograms to better understand clusters of \\nrecently-infected patients and spur \\nprogrammatic action in order to intervene to stop \\nactive infections (i.e., through interventions such \\nas index testing services and test & start). \\n• Outcome-focused cascade analyses (e.g., index \\ntesting, prevention). \\n• Further modernizations to treatment indicators to \\ncontinue to understand ART patient outcomes \\nand continuity of treatment in the era of \\ndifferentiated care (i.e., TX_ML, TX_RTT). \\n• A continued commitment to ensure data \\ndisaggregation by standard five-year age bands \\nin order to further enhance programmatic focus on strengthening patient-level monitoring systems. \\n• Ensuring COP-funding for health information systems projects is impactful and supports: (1) interoperability \\nbetween systems; (2) the adoption of standardized disaggregations; (3) shifts away from paper-based to \\nelectronic reporting; and (4) the adoption or expansion of HIV surveillance systems for public health \\nresponse. \\nPerson-centered monitoring and care is best practice in serving both the needs of the patient and the goals of \\nreaching epidemic control program more broadly. To reach epidemic control, all people living with HIV (PLHIV) \\nmust be identified, linked immediately to treatment, and have continuity of treatment to achieve viral \\nsuppression. If PLHIV do not have continuity of treatment, they are at risk of continued transmission and costly \\ninterventions are needed to track them.  \\nBoth the PEPFAR MER Guidance and the 2020 WHO Consolidated HIV Strategic Information Guidelines \\nunderscore the importance of tracing patients whose treatment has been interrupted. PEPFAR defines \\ninterruption in treatment (IIT) as no clinical contact for 28 days after the last scheduled appointment or expected \\nclinical contact. This is equivalent to the WHO concept of loss to follow up (LTFU). The use of the 28-day \\nstandard for IIT and LTFU is critical to promote timely identification of patient outcomes among patients known \\nto have missed clinical visits or drug pickups. Clients should be traced in an active, safe, and confidential way \\nthat assures sustained adherence to treatment moving forward. Health care workers should leverage best \\npractices to reach clients experiencing IIT, while protecting confidentiality. Interruptions in antiretroviral treatment \\ncan cause viral load to rebound in as little as one to two weeks in HIV+ patients that were previously suppressed \\non ART therapy. The longer a patient remains off treatment, the greater the likelihood that their viral load will \\nrebound to a point of no longer being undetectable. \\nBecause undetectable viral load means that patients cannot transmit HIV (U=U), it is important to get patients \\nback on treatment not only for their own health, but for the health of others in the community. Expeditious action \\nin defaulter tracing to bring clients back to treatment well before their viral load has the opportunity to rebound is \\na key example of how patient centered monitoring ensures the best outcome for both the patient and towards \\nour shared goal of epidemic control. However, some countries are struggling to maintain gains towards epidemic \\nFigure 2: Patient-Centered Monitoring in PEPFAR'),\n",

Triangulation of routine program data with underlying geographic, demographic, and \\nepidemiologic data is fundamental to PEPFAR planning, monitoring, and reporting processes. To ensure that no \\none in need of services is being left behind, PEPFAR requires the routine disaggregation of data by the following \\ncategories, where applicable: \\nLocation: PEPFAR clinical indicators are disaggregated to the facility-level. Where services are provided in the \\ncommunity, data are reported at an intermediate community-level (e.g., ward, sub-district, or district). PEPFAR \\nanalyses for planning and support focus on the subnational level (e.g., district).  \\nAge: In order to advance the standardization of patient monitoring and routine health information systems, \\nPEPFAR requires standardized reporting by five-year age bands. PEPFAR programs are required to report on \\nthe following standard age groups: <1, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, and \\n50+. Starting in FY22, the age bands for TX_CURR will be expanded to 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, and 65+. It is \\nrecommended that country teams review data on life expectancy and new infections and prepare to extend in-\\ncountry and/or national reporting systems beyond the 50+ age band threshold as appropriate.'),\n",

Both clinical and key population-specific partners should complete \\nthese disaggregations, but only if it is safe to maintain these files and report. The first priority of data \\ncollection and reporting of program data for key populations must be to DO NO HARM! These data \\nmust be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma \\nand discrimination of key populations. \\nThe key populations disaggregations for clinical indicators are as follows: people who inject drugs, men who \\nhave sex with men, transgender people, female sex workers, and people in prison and other closed settings.  \\nKey populations disaggregations are included for the following indicators: KP_PREV, HTS_TST, HTS_RECENT, \\nHTS_SELF, PrEP_NEW, PrEP_CT, TX_NEW, TX_CURR, TX_ML, TX_RTT, and TX_PVLS. However, it is \\nimportant to note that an individual’s inclusion in some key populations is subject to change over time (e.g., an \\nindividual may engage in sex work or inject drugs for specific periods in their life) and should be assessed at \\neach clinical encounter to ensure accurate reporting of these disaggregations on indicators such as TX_CURR. \\nThe PEPFAR key populations reporting guidance is designed to avoid double-counting and ensure that the KP \\ndata reported can be meaningfully interpreted. Despite persons potentially falling into more than one KP \\ndisaggregate (e.g., an FSW who injects drugs, MSM that is currently incarcerated), implementing partners \\nshould be instructed to report an individual in only one KP category with which s/he is most identified. This \\nguidance applies to all key populations-associated indicators. Refer to the key populations classification \\ndocument found in Appendix A for additional information on how to assess the needs of key populations client. \\nPriority Populations: PP_PREV includes a series of optional priority population types for reporting. Please note \\nthat although reporting of the priority populations disaggregation is optional – it is highly recommended. \\nTypes of PEPFAR Support: To understand the level of support and the type of investments being provided, \\ndata are disaggregated by either direct service delivery (DSD) or technical assistance for service delivery \\nimprovement (TA-SDI). More information on these categories is provided in the section below. \\nDISAGGREGATION TYPES: \\nThere are three categories of MER indicator disaggregations, which can be seen in the indicator reference \\nsheets and the DATIM data entry screens.  \\nRequired Disaggregations: Required indicates that this indicator disaggregate is required for all countries that \\nhave programming for this area. This means that if the country supports a program area, defined by budget and \\ntargets set during the COP process, then it is required to report results.  \\nConditional Disaggregations: Conditional disaggregates include those for which some additional condition \\nmust be fulfilled. There are two main types of conditional indicator disaggregations: \\na. Disaggregations for those programs that have received initiative-specific funds for special programming \\nsuch as DREAMS. There is also one full indicator, AGYW_PREV, that is conditional and based on \\nDREAMS funding. \\nb. Disaggregations for which field teams have received permission or a waiver from their PEPFAR \\nProgram Manager to report on, such as reporting on the coarse age disaggregations instead of the finer \\nage disaggregations. In this case reporting is considered conditional based on written approval from \\nOGAC.  \\nOptional Disaggregations: Optional disaggregates should be completed by those for which the indicator is \\nuseful to determine the success of their program (e.g., priority population disaggregations in PP_PREV).  \\nPEPFAR SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES AND SITES \\nCompleting the fourth full year of quarterly site-level monitoring by all PEPFAR implementing agencies and \\npartners has provided granular data that demonstrate important differences in patient outcomes and site \\nperformance. These results should be used to prioritize resources, staff, and interventions among sites to \\ndetermine the appropriate extent of support and monitoring needed based on site-level outputs and quality \\noutcomes.'),\n",

In areas where PEPFAR is supporting attained, scale-up, and sustained services the type of \\nsupport should be categorized as Direct Service Delivery (DSD) or Technical Assistance-Service Delivery \\nImprovement (TA-SDI).  \\nIn areas where PEPFAR is not providing support at the site level but is providing financial support at the national \\nor subnational levels, then this support should be characterized as Central Support (CS). DSD and TA-SDI \\ninclude all sites receiving one or more PEPFAR-supported visits during the year. Importantly, site-level quarterly \\nresults and SIMS data should be analyzed and used to determine the number of program support visits needed \\neach year to optimize the quality of HIV/AIDS services and impact. PEPFAR teams should work with \\nimplementing partners to ensure that programmatic data (including MER and SIMS results) are being used in \\nthis way. The key is to ensure that PEPFAR-supported sites receive the appropriate number of technical \\nassistance visits based on their performance. Refer to the “PEPFAR-support definition” section within each \\nindicator reference sheet for indicator-specific DSD and TA-SDI descriptions. \\nDSD: Individuals will be counted as receiving direct service delivery support from PEPFAR when BOTH of the \\nconditions below are met: Provision of key staff or commodities AND support to improve the quality of \\nservices through site visits as often as deemed necessary by the partner and country team.  \\nTA-SDI: Individuals will be counted as supported through TA-SDI when the point of service delivery receives \\nsupport from PEPFAR that meets the second criterion ONLY: support to improve the quality of services \\nthrough site visits as often as deemed necessary by the partner and country team. \\n1. PEPFAR is directly interacting with the patient or beneficiary in response to their health (physical, \\npsychological, etc.) care needs by providing key staff and/or essential commodities for routine service \\ndelivery. Staff who are responsible for the completeness and quality of routine patient records (paper or \\nelectronic) can be counted here; however, staff who exclusively fulfill MOH and donor reporting \\nrequirements cannot be counted. Each indicator reference sheet includes a list of key staff and/or \\nessential commodities that meet this condition. \\nAND/OR \\n2. PEPFAR provides an established presence at and/or routinized support for those services at the point of \\nservice delivery. Each indicator reference sheet includes a list of activities that count toward support for \\nservice delivery improvement. \\nSUPPORT IN CENTRALLY SUPPORTED AREAS: In areas where PEPFAR is solely providing \\nfinancial support at the national, regional or district level, site level support will be through annual visits. \\nHowever, to support the host country government with quality monitoring, it is recommended that results \\nreported through national health information systems should be jointly monitored with the government on a \\nquarterly basis. SIMS visits may also be conducted at these sites if quality issues are identified.  \\nDue to the financial investments PEPFAR provides at the above-service delivery area in centrally supported \\nsites and SNUs, it is important that results be provided to ensure that quality assurance initiatives are having the \\nintended impact. PEPFAR programs should be focused on supporting the national program in their respective \\ncountry to achieve 90% ART coverage (i.e., 95-95-95) for PLHIV; therefore, it is extremely important to \\nunderstand the services provided to PLHIV across the entire country. \\nWhile patient and beneficiary-support activities have transitioned to government or other support, PEPFAR \\ncontinues to provide support for overarching activities, such as quality assurance and quality improvement \\n(QA/QI) to ensure that patients continue to receive quality services. As such, PEPFAR will continue monitoring \\nactivities in centrally supported sites annually via the following indicators: HTS_TST, TX_CURR, TX_NEW, \\nTX_PVLS, PMTCT_STAT, and PMTCT_ART.  \\nResults in centrally supported areas should be reported once annually at Q4 each year. Site-level data in \\ncentrally-supported areas should be reported on the Central Support (CS) tab of the DATIM data entry screen \\nfor each of the six indicators required for centrally supported reporting: HTS_TST, TX_CURR, TX_NEW, \\nTX_PVLS, PMTCT_STAT, and PMTCT_ART.

Monitoring the host country HIV response is critical to understanding both the achievements and the \\ngaps at the subnational level and within specific populations. Host country data are used to inform PEPFAR \\nprograms and guide how PEPFAR resources are allocated. The key program areas for monitoring host country \\ntargets and results are: prevention of mother to child transmission programs, key populations, voluntary male \\nmedical circumcision and HIV diagnosis and treatment, including viral suppression.  \\nHost country data are needed from both the national and subnational level. The subnational level is considered \\nthe organizational level in which the country team has prioritized their program (PSNU). Data on the host \\ncountry national program is reported to PEPFAR for all subnational units, regardless of PEPFAR funding \\nsupporting these geographical areas; so that the total of the subnational results or targets should equal the total \\nnumber of national results and targets. \\nIncreasingly, individual-level surveillance data are critical to implement and used in conjunction with the MOH to \\ncapture data from recent infections to deaths. \\nAt the host country national level, to sufficiently monitor its national response, the host country government’s \\nnational set of indicators should include the minimum set of harmonized global indicators (UNAIDS Global AIDS \\nMonitoring) and additional indicators that represent the needs of the country’s program. The PEPFAR Country \\nteam should collaborate with the host country government and other stakeholders to make sure that PEPFAR \\nreporting requirements are taken into consideration in the host country’s national set.

Completeness checks begin at the site level \\nwith routine review of patient level data at the source of collection such as registers, EMRs or patient charts. \\nThese patient monitoring tools should be reviewed for entry completeness at each reporting period.  \\n \\nOnce implementing partner staff have completed data entry for the reporting period, the IP should confirm the \\noverall completeness of data by reviewing a set of DATIM “Favorites” that display MER indicators’ “numerator” \\nvalue  and “denominator” values by disaggregation totals (e.g., total by age/sex, total by service delivery \\npoint/test result, total by age/sex/service type, etc.). An overview of DATIM completeness favorites and \\ninstructions on how to use them can be found below. \\n \\nWhen USG agency staff “Accept” MER results data from IPs within DATIM, these same DATIM Favorites should \\nbe reviewed to verify data completeness; if any issues are identified, these should be flagged by the AOR/COR, \\nActivity Manager, or SI point of contact and returned to the IP for corrections or revisions. A set of data \\nvalidation and logic checks should also be carried out between indicators before data is submitted to \\nInteragency.  \\nDATA ENTRY AND REVIEW PROCESS OVERVIEW \\nThe in-country review of data completeness is a shared responsibility across all stakeholders, including data \\nentry and review by implementing partners, review by agency, and further review and de-duplication data at the \\nInteragency level. \\n \\nFigure 6.

In addition, guiding narrative questions were introduced for \\nFY 2018 reporting to provide additional technical detail and continuity within the narratives submitted across \\nPEPFAR countries. \\nGUIDING NARRATIVE QUESTIONS \\nGuiding narratives questions have been developed for each PEPFAR indicator to ensure that there is continuity \\nin the technical information reported through the narratives and that this information will be most relevant to \\nsubject matter experts in triangulating the narrative data with the quantitative results. \\nEach indicator has 3-5 questions or prompts included within the indicator reference sheet that should guide both \\nimplementing partners and USG technical area experts in the development and framing of both the IM and \\ntechnical area narratives – in addition to the narrative requirements provided in the paragraphs below. \\nIMPLEMENTING MECHANISM (IM) INDICATOR NARRATIVES \\nNarratives are required each quarter. These narratives are an opportunity to convey additional context to \\naccompany the quantitative results. IM level narratives are required for each reported indicator and should: \\n• Respond to the guiding narrative questions defined in the indicator reference sheet, as \\napplicable. \\n• Provide additional information related to specific data quality concerns or programmatic issues that may \\nimpact the assessment of partner performance. Indicate whether data quality assessments were \\nconducted during the reporting period and the impact the assessment had on the results and program.  \\n• If appropriate, reference specific site-level issues that were encountered during the reporting period that \\nmay prevent achievement of the IM target.  \\n• Provide additional information that is useful for the interpretation of the results on an indicator-specific \\nbasis.  \\n• Describe the nature of support the partner is providing that qualifies the results to be categorized as \\nDirect Service Delivery (DSD) or Technical Assistance for Service Delivery Improvement (TA-SDI) in \\naccordance with PEPFAR guidance.  \\nUSG TECHNICAL AREA INDICATOR NARRATIVES \\nTechnical area level narratives summarize the PEPFAR OU’s de-duplicated achievements against targets. \\nThese narratives should: \\n• Respond to the guiding narrative questions defined in the indicator reference sheet, as \\napplicable. \\n• Provide additional information that would be useful for the interpretation of the results, including specific \\ndata quality concerns or programmatic issues that may impact the assessment of overall performance. \\n• Describe the nature of support the partners are providing that qualifies the results to be categorized as \\nDirect Service Delivery (DSD) or Technical Assistance for Service Delivery Improvement (TA-SDI) in \\naccordance with PEPFAR MER guidance. \\n• Describe the achievements in light of expected trajectories for the technical area. \\n• Provide information on data quality assessment (DQA) completion in the last 12 months. \\n• Address achievements by prioritization level and DSD and TA-SDI support. For example, is there an \\noverlap between PEPFAR and the Global Fund in support for ART services? \\nHOST COUNTRY INDICATOR TARGETS & RESULTS NARRATIVES \\nNational level indicator narratives provide an opportunity for teams to discuss the host country response beyond \\nPEPFAR supported activities.

These \\nnarratives are collected in DATIM and country teams should respond to the initiative-specific prompts and \\nguidance listed in the “Monitoring Special Initiatives” chapter.   \\nCALCULATED INDICATORS \\nA calculated indicator is a MER indicator that is generated using values that were entered manually via DATIM. \\nCalculated indicators facilitate analysis of MER data and reduce the chance for error introduced by manual \\ncalculations. Three types of calculated indicators are shown below. Please refer to Appendix B for a detailed list \\nof calculated indicators and their corresponding calculations. \\n \\nType 1: Sum of disaggregates to Total Numerator \\nThe “Total Numerator” value for each indicator is calculated from the sum of specific disaggregates within the \\nindicator. This prevents discrepancies resulting from entering the total numerator and disaggregates separately.  \\n \\nExample: \\nTB_STAT Total Numerator =  \\nTB_STAT Known Positives by age/sex \\n+ TB_STAT Newly Tested Positives by age/sex \\n+ TB_STAT New Negatives by age/sex \\n \\nType 2: Sum of disaggregates to new disaggregate \\nOften, there are specific groups of disaggregates that are reviewed on a routine basis. Rather than summing the \\ndisaggregates during each analysis, a calculated disaggregate is generated to facilitate the review. In this \\nexample, TB_STAT_POS is calculated to generate the total number of HIV-positive individuals documented as \\npart of TB_STAT.  \\n \\nExample: \\nTB_STAT_POS =  \\nTB_STAT Known Positives by age/sex  \\n                      + TB_STAT Newly Tested Positives by age/sex  \\n      \\nType 3: Copying of data to new indicator \\nIn many cases, data that is collected as part of one indicator is useful for analysis in another indicator. Rather \\nthan require that the same data be entered in multiple places, the data can be entered once and copied to other \\nsystem-generated indicators. In this example, the number of HIV-positive TB cases is collected as part of \\nTB_STAT, and used as the denominator for TB_ART. TB_ART (D) is not entered directly – it is generated \\nautomatically using values that were originally entered under TB_STAT.'),\n",

Measuring the success of PEPFAR’s initiatives requires \\nstrong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems that can routinely produce high quality data. Efforts to ensure \\ndata quality, therefore, are not singular events occurring randomly. Rather, these processes need to become \\ninstitutionalized as part of the entire data management cycle. Once achieved, data quality helps to ensure that \\nlimited resources are used effectively, progress toward established goals is accurately monitored, measured and \\nreported, and decisions are based on strong evidence.  \\n \\nOver the past five years, efforts to ensure a data-driven approach to decision making has allowed global HIV \\nprograms to dramatically expand their results and impact in a budget-neutral environment. The combination of \\nstrengthened monitoring indicators, information regarding site and service delivery quality, site-specific program \\nresults, and a more detailed understanding of the geographic distribution of the burden of disease has allowed \\nHIV programs to identify exactly where the HIV epidemic is occurring and where programs can maximize their \\nimpact in response. \\n \\nData quality has always been a focus of global HIV monitoring and reporting efforts. Specifically, all countries \\nconducting programming supported by PEPFAR are expected to have a data quality strategy in place. For \\nexample, data quality assessments (DQAs) should be routinely conducted and action should be taken because \\nof these DQAs. If errors are identified in data, these should be remediated at the point of service delivery as well \\nas in the PEPFAR and host-country reporting systems as soon as possible.  \\n \\nMore specifically, as many countries are approaching the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals, it is more important than \\never to understand exactly how many people living with HIV are receiving treatment. Furthermore, it is \\nimperative that countries understand the treatment gaps remaining by location and population to ensure that all \\nPLHIV have equitable access to treatment and are virally suppressed and that scarce resources are allocated \\nappropriately to areas with the greatest unmet need. As such, we are at a very important moment in the HIV \\nresponse where accuracy of the data is essential in ensuring that programmatic decisions are made effectively. \\nPEPFAR is committed to ensuring that the data collected through the MER is accurate and timely. It is \\nessential to not only capture high-quality data, but to also continuously use and analyze the data to \\nachieve maximum program impact. The only way to improve the data is to use the data. \\n \\nUnderstanding the treatment gaps by location and populations means conducting DQAs by age and sex to \\ncorrect discrepancies by population that exist in the TX_CURR numbers. Significant shifts in age and sex \\ncoverage levels can be observed when TX_CURR numbers are reset based on DQAs.  \\nFor more information on data quality, please refer to “Data Quality Assessment of National and Partner HIV \\nTreatment and Patient Monitoring Systems.” The approved DQA protocol from this guidance can also be found \\nin Appendix C.'),\n",

With greater emphasis on patient-centered monitoring comes a need to \\nunderstand patient-level data beyond the aggregate indicators.  \\nHIV programmatic aggregate data are not fully de-duplicated (though within antiretroviral treatment programs \\nmany are) and do not provide data on the number of people living with HIV or accurate data for total persons \\ndiagnosed. Periodic surveys offer individual de-duplicated data, denominators, and the 95-95-95 cascade, but \\nare cross-sectional (one point in time) and are expensive to conduct. \\nStandardized health data surveillance systems offer countries a mechanism to complement aggregate reporting \\nsystems and surveys with quality HIV data that emphasizes individual de-duplicated data to more accurately \\nreport the 95-95-95 cascade. \\nThese surveillance systems, when comprehensive, emphasize case finding and case reporting of new \\ndiagnoses (including recent infections), identify if the newly diagnosed are linked to treatment, and provide \\ndisaggregation by age, sex, geography, and risk. This in turn can trigger a public health response to effectively \\nintervene and make the necessary adjustments from a surveillance and programmatic perspective to prevent \\nnew cases as countries strive to achieve and sustain epidemic control. There are several paths countries can \\ntake to obtain standardized health data exchanges and surveillance systems that track individual patients with \\nthe removal of duplicates by key HIV sentinel events [first HIV positive diagnoses (by new and chronic infection), \\nfirst CD4 count (after diagnosis), antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation, first viral load test, viral suppression \\n(follow up viral load tests), and death]. We describe two paths: (1) case-based surveillance (CBS) and (2) \\nlinkage of routine program data. Both approaches allow countries to monitor HIV cases longitudinally, providing \\nreal-time estimates of new diagnosis, treatment, and viral suppression by age, sex, and sub-national unit.  \\nMany countries see the need and importance of standardized health data exchanges and surveillance systems \\nbut are not sure where to begin, what is needed, or do not have the requisite system attributes. For example, \\ncountries lack interoperability within their health systems infrastructure for data linkage between services to \\noccur, methods to uniquely identify patients, and the important endpoint of mortality due to inadequate vital \\nregistration systems. \\nCOMMITMENT TO DATA TRANSPARENCY \\nPEPFAR is committed to data transparency. Site (de-identified) and SNU-level results are posted each quarter \\nfor the public to view, download, and analyze through Panorama Spotlight. \\n \\nFor more in-depth analyses, partners and stakeholders external to PEPFAR may request access to data for \\nadditional PEPFAR data elements. For more specific information around data sharing in PEPFAR, please \\nconsult the PEPFAR Data Governance policy.'),\n",

All 15 DREAMS countries will be required to submit a DREAMS \\nLayering Table detailing their primary/secondary/contextual interventions for each age band \\nto S/GAC and their AGYW ISMEs on an annual basis.  \\n• Primary services/interventions are defined as interventions that ALL AGYW in an age \\ngroup should receive if they are enrolled in DREAMS in an OU.  \\n• Secondary services/interventions are needs-based interventions that are part of an \\nOU’s DREAMS core package but may not be received by all AG W in that age group \\n(i.e., only AGYW who experience violence should receive post-violence care).  \\n• Contextual interventions are those that are part of an OU’s DREAMS core package but \\ncannot be linked to an individual AGYW (i.e., community mobilization). Note that these \\ninterventions should be included in your layering table but are not tracked as part of the \\nAGYW_PREV indicator as, by definition, they are not linked to individual AGYW.  \\n \\nOnly services provided by PEPFAR count under AGYW_PREV. However, if PEPFAR \\nimplementing partners are making active referrals to a service provided by a non-PEPFAR \\nentity, the active referral may be counted as a DREAMS service under AG YW_PREV. If this \\nis the case, your OU-specific Layering Table should specify this (e.g., “facilitating access to \\ngovernment education subsidies” instead of just “education subsidies”). \\n \\nCounting Service and Package Completion:  \\nServices/interventions should only be counted towards primary package completion if the \\nAGYW has completed that particular service/intervention. Countries should define \\nservice/intervention completion as part of their country-specific DREAMS Layering \\nTable. Completion definitions should be based on normative guidance and instructions from \\nprogram developers where available (e.g., country may count a multi-session intervention \\nas complete after participant has attended 80% of the sessions if that is what the \\ninstructions from the program developer indicate as completion). Do not count an \\nintervention towards primary/secondary package completion for an individual AGYW until it \\nhas been completed per the country’s service completion definition. Please note that \\n“primary package completion” as tracked in AG W_PRE  and “DREAMS program \\ncompletion” as defined in the DREAMS Guidance are not the same thing. DREAMS \\nprogram completion requires that an individual AGYW has completed both the primary \\npackage for her age group, as well as all secondary interventions that are appropriate \\nbased on her needs. \\n \\nAn AGYW must have completed at least one service in the past 6 months at Q2 or the past \\n12 months at Q4 to be counted in any of the following disaggregates: “completed the full \\nprimary package and no additional services”, “completed the primary package and at least \\none additional service”, or “completed at least one service but not the full primary package.” \\nAt Q2 and Q4 reporting, AGYW should be reported under the disaggregate that reflects the \\nsnapshot of her current layering status since beginning the DREAMS program. Fo r \\nexample, if an AGYW completed her last service in the primary package in the last 6 \\nmonths (at Q2) or 12 months (at Q4) then she may be counted in the corresponding \\nnumerator disaggregate for the current time period, even if she enrolled and began \\nreceiving services in DREAMS beginning in a previous year or reporting period. For AGYW \\nreported in the disaggregate of “completed at least one service but not the fully primary \\npackage”, any DREAMS service (from the primary or secondary package) may be counted.  \\n \\nAn AGYW that is enrolled and has started a DREAMS service but has not yet completed it \\nas of the end of the reporting period is still considered an active DREAMS participant (see \\nabove). She would be reported in the corresponding disaggregate. If an AGY W has already \\ncompleted a DREAMS service/intervention while in DREAMS, she should be reported \\nunder one of the layering disaggregates indicating service completion. For example, if an \\nAGYW has completed HTS but is in process of completing a multi-session prevention \\ncurriculum at Q2 (and has not yet completed the primary package), she should be counted'),\n",

Specific services received by AGYW will continue to be counted under \\nPP_PREV, OVC_SERV, HTS_TST, PREP_NEW, PREP_CT, PMTCT_STAT, GEND_GBV, \\nKP_PREV, etc. as appropriate. Furthermore, AGYW enrolled in DREAMS and receiving \\nDREAMS services should be counted under this indicator regardless of the intervention(s) \\nfunding the services that they received. For example, if an AGYW is enrolled in DREAMS \\nand receives HIV testing, education support, and PrEP in the reporting period, she would be \\ncounted under HTS_TST, PREP_NEW, PREP_CT, and OVC_SERV if she meets the \\ndefinition of each respective indicator. She would also be counted under AGYW_PREV \\nunder the appropriate layering and time in DREAMS disaggregates to track if she has \\nreceived the age-appropriate primary package of DREAMS services/interventions. \\n \\nActive DREAMS participants ages 10-17 years that receive eligible OVC service(s) and who \\nare not otherwise enrolled in the OVC Comprehensive program should be counted under \\nthe O C_SER  “DREAMS” disaggregate (see O C_SER  reference sheet). An illustrative \\nlist of eligible services can be found in Appendix E (e.g. education support, primary \\nprevention of HIV and violence intervention, etc.). AGYW meeting this definition should be \\nreported under both AGYW_PREV and the OVC_SERV DREAMS disaggregate regardless \\nof partner or funding type. \\n \\nAGYW_PREV was not created to measure or show the impact of DREAMS, it was created \\nto monitor fidelity to layering and to assess DREAMS implementation on the ground. \\nDREAMS country teams should review multiple data sources (i.e., ongoing analyses per th e \\nDREAMS Program Completion and Saturation Document) along with AGYW_PREV to \\nevaluate overall DREAMS program performance and coverage.  \\n \\nResults from this indicator will be used to ensure that layering of DREAMS services is \\nhappening across agencies and partners within DREAMS districts and will be used to make \\nprogrammatic decisions to ensure comprehensive, patient-centered prevention \\nprogramming for AGYW. AGYW_PREV results will help field teams and HQ answer several \\nessential questions related to DREAMS programming, quality, and reach, including:  \\n1. How many active DREAMS participants are in the DREAMS program?  \\n2. Is layering happening as intended for all AGYW receiving DREAMS services? Are there \\nspecific services/interventions that are not reaching AGYW as intended? Are there \\nspecific SNUs where layering is stronger or weaker? Are there specific age bands \\nwhere layering is stronger or weaker? \\n3. How does layering change over the time a girl is enrolled in DREAMS?  \\na. Benchmark: Have 90% of active DREAMS participants completed at \\nleast the primary package after being in DREAMS for 13+ months? \\nb. How long is it taking for AGYW (by age band) to complete the primary \\npackage? (e.g. we would not expect AGYW in the younger age bands to \\ncomplete the primary package in <6 months)   \\n4. Where are active DREAMS participants along the DREAMS program completion \\ncontinuum?  \\nPlease refer to the “Data  isualization & Use” section below for example visualizations of \\nAG W_PRE .

It is \\nrecommended that one coordinating partner track layering data within an OU; however, \\nsince layering occurs between multiple implementing partners and across time and \\nmechanisms the USG team (DREAMS Coordinator or DREAMS POC(s)) is best placed \\nto input the data for AGYW_PREV. \\n \\nData collection requires reliable tracking systems that are designed to count the number of \\none-on-one encounters or participation in group interventions and that reduce double -\\ncounting of individuals in a reporting period. A unique identifier should be assigned to \\nAGYW enrolled in DREAMS to track individual-level completion of DREAMS services \\nacross partners providing DREAMS services, where applicable.

It captures information about whether FP \\nintegration is occurring at various HIV service delivery points within PEPFAR  supported \\nsites. Many PEPFAR sites will have numerous service delivery points within each site.

If \\nreferrals are given, they must include detailed information (e.g., facility location, hours \\nof operation, etc.) about where methods can be accessed. \\n \\nAssess Voluntary Family Planning Needs Through Screening (Number 1 above):  In \\nassessing FP needs, all clients as part of their routine care visit should be asked about their \\nFP needs and practices. Depending upon the individual client and his or her needs, these \\ncan include: reproductive goals; prior pregnancies; living and family situation; FP \\nknowledge; previously used FP methods and satisfaction with use; and any FP-related \\nconcerns. These needs should be assessed without expressing any personal biases about \\na client’s preference.  \\n \\nProvide Voluntary Family Planning Counseling (including Safe Pregnancy Counseling) \\n(Number 2 above): Quality voluntary FP counseling should cover a wide range of topics that \\nare client and context specific, and that include both safe pregnancy counseling for \\nindividuals who wish to become pregnant as well as contraception for individuals  who wish \\nto avoid, space or delay pregnancy. “FP counseling” is not the same as \"FP education\". \\nDepending upon the type of FP services that are offered at PEPFAR supported site; health \\nproviders or community mobilizers may provide EDUCATION and/or COUNSEL ING on FP. \\n \\nEducation activities may include distribution of printed materials, group health education \\nand community outreach efforts among other interventions. Education helps to increase \\ngeneral knowledge on the benefits and importance of FP and increase support for FP use, \\nas well as to link women and their partners to other FP services, including contraceptive \\nmethod provision. \\n  \\nFP counseling is an interpersonal communication between the health provider and client \\nwhere topics specific to the clients’ needs are discussed to help them determine if they want \\nto use FP and if so; to help them choose and use the FP method of their choice. HIV \\nservice providers or all levels can be trained and supported to develop or improve their \\nskills at FP counseling. A wide array of FP counseling materials exist that can be used in \\nPEPFAR settings; including national FP flipcharts, counseling cards and informational \\nhandouts \\n \\nProvision or Referral of a Broad Range of Modern Contraceptive Methods (Number 3 \\nabove): Per U.S. Government legislation, and in line with national FP policies, a broad \\nrange of methods should be provided to clients, allowing them to choose the method most \\nappropriate for them, either directly or through referral. For an SDP to be counted towards \\nthis indicator, at least three modern contraceptive methods should be available either on \\nsite or through referral.

Please note, if a site has multiple locations to \\nsupport one HIV service, only one SDP should be reported. For example, if a hospital \\nconducts HIV testing on Floor 2 and Floor 3 and integrates family planning into testing \\nservices, only one service delivery point should be reported.  \\n \\nGuiding narrative \\nquestions: \\n1. Which service delivery points within supported facilities are providing integrated family \\nplanning services to people living with HIV or those at risk of acquiring HIV? (e.g., HIV \\nprevention, HTS, C&T, PMTCT, KP, etc.)  \\n2. What contraceptive services or methods are provided on site, and which contraceptive \\nmethods are provided through referral?

This de-duplication is critical to accurately track the ANNUAL number of unique \\nindividuals reached by PEPFAR within a given fiscal year. Trend analysis of past performance \\nof KP_PREV data will be adversely affected with the change in frequency of KP_PREV \\nreporting from annually to semi-annually if this de-duplication is ignored (i.e., annual number of \\nKP_PREV reported within the same fiscal year would be inflated as the same individual would \\nbe counted twice if this de-duplication does not occur at Q4 reporting). \\n \\nIf possible, a unique identifier can be assigned.

To meet this \\nmandate, PEPFAR’s Orphans and  ulnerable Children (O C) programming serves the dual \\npurposes of mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS on children and adolescents and their families, as \\nwell as preventing HIV/AIDS-related morbidity and mortality.  \\n \\nCOP21 Guidance details an approach to risk and resilience for the OVC portfolio that responds to \\nthe current stage of the HI /AIDS pandemic and the child’s needs. To implement this framework, \\nthree distinct but complementary models are required to address children’s vulnerabilities and \\nprovide appropriate support services: OVC Comprehensive, OVC Preventive, and DREAMS \\n(Figure 1).

To ensure \\nthat individual children and adolescents are not double-counted under this indicator, the following \\nhierarchy of the OVC_SERV program models must be followed when reporting on OVC_SERV \\n(Figures 2 & 3). In some OUs and SNUs, this may require implementing partners to compare their \\nprogram cohorts to determine under which OVC_SERV program model disaggregate an \\nindividual should be counted. Example scenarios are below: \\n● A 14-year-old girl is enrolled in the OVC Comprehensive Program, is an active DREAMS \\nparticipant, and has completed an approved primary prevention of HIV and sexual \\nviolence intervention. She should be reported exclusively in the “O C Comprehensive” \\ndisaggregate by the partner implementing the OVC Comprehensive program. The \\npartners who serve her in the OVC Preventive or DREAMS program should not report \\nher under OVC_SERV.  \\n● A 10-year-old boy is enrolled in the OVC Comprehensive Program and also completes an \\napproved primary prevention of HIV and sexual violence intervention. He should be \\nreported exclusively under the “O C Comprehensive” disaggregate. The partner \\nimplementing the OVC Preventive program should not report this participant under \\nOVC_SERV because he is already being reported under OVC_SERV through the partner \\nimplementing the OVC Comprehensive program. \\n● A 13-year-old girl is an active DREAMS participant, completes an approved primary \\nprevention of HIV and sexual violence intervention, and is NOT enrolled in the OVC \\nComprehensive Program. She should be reported exclusively under the “DREAMS” \\ndisaggregate when she completes her first OVC_SERV eligible service (see Appendix E). \\nShe should also be counted under AGYW_PREV. The partner implementing the OVC \\nPreventive program should not report this participant in their results because she is \\nalready being reported under OVC_SERV through the partner implementing DREAMS. \\n● A 12-year-old boy completes an approved primary prevention of HIV and sexual violence \\nintervention and is not enrolled in the OVC Comprehensive program. He should be \\nreported exclusively under the “O C Preventive” disaggregate. This is the only scenario \\nwhere the partner implementing the OVC Preventive program will report an individual \\nunder OVC_SERV -- when it is the only program model an individual is participating in.  \\n● A 19-year-old female is completing secondary education with OVC program support and \\nis the caregiver of a child in the OVC Comprehensive program. Both she and her child \\nshould be reported as “O C” under the “O C Comprehensive” disaggregate.

In this context, index testing refers to any HIV testing of the \\ncontacts of an index client (i.e., a person known to be HIV positive). Only the following \\npersons count as contacts: current or past sexual partner(s), biological children \\n/parents (if index case is a child) or anyone with whom a needle was shared. \\nBiological children reported under HTS_INDEX should only include children of an HIV -\\npositive mother. Children of male-index clients (fathers) should only be included when the \\nbiological mother is HIV-positive, she is deceased, or her HIV status is not known or not \\ndocumented. Conversely, if the index client is the child, his/her mother should be tested, \\nand if the mother is HIV-positive or deceased, the father should be tested as well. In \\naddition, all biologic siblings of the index child should be tested. In this way, provision of \\nindex testing services is non-directional, whereby we are trying to follow transmission of the \\ndisease. Every newly diagnosed individual becomes a subsequent index client from whom \\nto elicit contacts. Like HTS_TST and HTS_SELF, HTS_INDEX is reported at the facility and \\ncommunity levels.  \\n \\nTesting of persons who have not had exposure through an index client, such as neighbors \\nor family members (e.g., children of HIV-negative mother, grandparents, etc.) not born to \\nthe index, should not be reported under HTS_INDEX. Testing of non-contacts should be \\nreported under the modality that best reflects the service delivery point where testing \\noccurred. For example, if HIV testing were conducted in a mobile clinic, unexposed contacts \\nwould be reported under the ‘Mobile’ modality of HTS_TST.  \\n \\nAll index testing services must meet WHO’s 5C minimum standards, including consent, \\ncounseling, confidentiality, correct test results, and connection to HIV prevention (for both \\nHIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals), and HIV care and treatment (often referred to as \\n‘linkage’, for HI -positive individuals). The 5 C’s are essential for all HTS, especially in the \\ncontext of identifying contacts for HIV testing. Additionally, all index clients should be \\nscreened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) per WHO guidelines. An index client should \\nnever feel as if they are required to provide contacts in order to receive any services. \\nOverall, all index testing services being offered at all PEPFAR-supported sites should \\nadhere to PEPFAR’s Guidance on Implementing Safe and Ethical Index Testing Services.'),\n",

Additional \\nmonitoring, such as through SIMS and adverse events monitoring and remediation efforts, \\nis essential in order to ensure compliance with the index testing guidance.  \\n \\nHTS_INDEX is separated into several steps (1-4 below) that are aligned with core \\ncomponents of index testing implementation. These steps are part of a cascade of \\nimplementation that begins with an offer of index testing services to the index client and \\nends in provision of an HIV test (and results) to the contacts named by the index client. This \\nfinal step 4 (and the age sex disaggregates) will auto-populate into the ‘Index’ modality in \\nHTS_TST for either facility or community.  \\n \\nThe steps are: \\n1. How many index clients were offered index testing services? This is the number of \\nindex clients (newly diagnosed positive, previously known positives who are not on \\nART, or clients with unsuppressed viral load) who were offered (e.g., counseled on) \\nindex testing services (regardless of whether or not those services were accepted by \\nthe index client) in compliance with PEPFAR’s Guidance on Implementing Safe and \\nEthical Index Testing Services.  \\n2. How many index clients accepted index testing services? This is the number of \\nindex clients who accepted (e.g., agreed to) provision of index testing services by a \\nprovider (including client providing informed consent, acceptance of counseling on \\nindex testing, acceptance of elicitation of current or past sexual partners/partner \\nnotification, etc.).  \\n3. How many contacts did the index client provide? This is the number of contacts \\nprovided by the index client as a result of accepting index testing services. The index \\nclient provides the age (<15 or >15) and sex (male or female) of the contact(s). Since \\nthe index client ‘self-reports’ these data, the contact’s recorded age and/or sex does not \\nneed to be corrected in Step 3 if differing age/sex information is collected in Step 4. As \\nmentioned above, contacts are only sexual partners, biological children/parents, and \\nanyone with whom a needle was shared.  \\n4. How many contacts were tested for HIV and received their results? Of those tested \\nand received their results, how many tested positive and negative? This is the number \\nof contacts who were tested for HIV and received their results (positive and negative). \\nThe positive and negative disaggregations do not include the contact’s self-reported \\nstatus; only the actual provision of an HIV test to the contact. However, please note that \\nprevious or known positives are also recorded as “known positive” in Step 4. Known \\npositives should not be retested. \\nChildren of index contacts who have a documented negative test (not a self-test) can be \\nreported as “documented negative with no other HI  exposure risk” (documented \\nnegative). Children reported in this category should have received a final negative HIV \\ntest at 18 months of age or 3 months after breastfeeding ended, whichever occurred \\nlater. Children who received a negative HIV test after this time may also be counted. \\nChildren with any known or suspected HIV exposure should be retested, including but \\nnot limited to: breastfeeding from an HIV-positive mother, known or suspected sexual \\nactivity, contact or abuse, needle stick exposure (unsafe injection practices) or throu gh \\na blood transfusion. If a child is reported to have received a negative test in the past but \\nthe documentation is missing or unavailable, the child should be retested rather than \\nwaiting to retrieve the documentation. The documented negative disaggregat e applies \\nonly to index contacts in the pediatric age bands (<15y years of age). All index contacts \\n≥15 years of age who are not known positive should receive an HIV test, regardless of \\nwhether they are a child of an index case or other type of contact.'),\n",

For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or \\nfacility- level must be confirmed with a second and third (in some contexts) test, which \\nmay be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is \\nperformed at a different facility, then this may require follow-up by implementing \\npartners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on the Step 4.  \\n• For children <1, only if serologic tests used for diagnostic purposes should they be \\nreported under HTS_INDEX. Serologic tests for screening infants should be excluded \\n(including tests to look for HIV exposure at age 9 months or another time point). For \\nexample, you may use the HTS_INDEX <1 disaggregate to report negative diagnostic \\nresults if a serologic-based test is used to confirm the absence of HIV infection in \\ninfants <1-year-old who have not breastfed for at least 3 months prior to testing. \\nHowever, since diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is typically based on virologic, and \\nnot serologic tests, the general expectation is not to see results in the “<1” \\ndisaggregate of the HTS_INDEX indicator. HIV virologic testing of HIV-exposed infants \\nshould be counted under PMTCT_EID. \\n• Programs that utilize the ‘dual-referral’ approach (i.e., the provider/counselor sits with \\nan index client and their partner(s) to assist with disclosure and/or partner testing) may \\nwant to offer re-testing to the index client to protect his or her safety. In this case, the \\nindex client’s test result should NOT be counted again under HTS_INDEX or \\nHTS_TST. Individuals who undergo couples testing (i.e., neither partner knows their \\nstatus) should be counted under HTS_TST and the appropriate service delivery \\nmodality should be indicated (e.g., ANC). \\n• The partner elicitation process of index testing is a continuous process. \\nProviders/counselors should follow local SOPs to determine when PLHIV are asked \\nagain about any new partners or previous partners that may not have been disclosed \\nby the index client previously. That is, for Step 3 on ‘Contacts Elicited’, contacts may \\nnot be elicited all in one session with the HTS counselor. Elicitation may even continue \\ninto the next reporting quarter.  \\n• Some of the contacts tested in Step 4, may not have been part of the elicitation \\nprocess in Step 2 and Step 3. Contacts may choose to come forward themselves after \\na discussion with the index client (for example). Regardless, any contact who is tested \\nfor HIV should be counted under Step 4.  \\n• Retesting for verification of HIV positive status before or at antiretroviral (ART) initiation \\nshould not be counted under HTS_INDEX. Retesting for verification is primarily \\nconducted as a quality assurance activity to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure those \\ninitiated on ART are indeed HIV positive. Therefore, retesting for verification should \\nonly be conducted for persons who have received an HIV diagnosis, but have not yet \\nbeen initiated on ART.  \\n \\nPlease refer to HTS_TST for information on Data Quality and reporting \\nconsiderations that would also apply here.  \\n \\nKey Populations:  \\nProvision of data (on any of the steps outlined above) specific to key populations (FSW, \\nMSM, Transgender people, PWID, and people in prisons and other closed settings) who \\nwere tested and received their results should be included but not disaggregated into a \\nseparate ‘KP’ disaggregate. That is, there is no separate Key Population disaggregate \\nrequested (unlike HTS_TST). The first priority of data collection and reporting of testing for \\nthe index client and their contacts, particularly key populations, must be to do no harm. \\nThese data must be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are \\nprotected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations.

Incorporation of rapid tests for recent HIV-1 infection (RTRI) \\ninto routine HIV testing services will facilitate the establishment of a surveillance system to \\nquickly detect, monitor, and characterize recent infections among newly diagnosed HIV cases. \\nData from a recent infection surveillance system contribute to data-driven approaches to fine-\\ntune a country’s programmatic response through prioritized programming and resource \\nallocation. \\n \\nRecommended use of this indicator is described below. For additional information on recent \\ninfection surveillance, please refer to the PEPFAR guidance on recent infection testing,  \\nplanning and implementation resources including template protocol, SOPs, training materials, \\nand tools available on the Tracking with Recency Assays to Control the Epidemic (TRACE)  \\neLearning Hub, and the emerging technology page on pepfarsolutions.org.  \\n \\n• Surveillance: Characterization of recent and long-term HIV infections will enable the \\nidentification of geographic areas and/or demographic groups that may benefit from \\nintensified prevention and testing activities. Results may also be used to monitor epidemic \\ntrends over time. \\n• Public Health Program Response: Monitoring the number and percentage of recent \\ninfections by facility and community can be used to identify areas with ongoing active \\ntransmission, in order to quickly target education, prevention, and testing resources to \\nincrease case finding, intensify index testing services, ensure timely ART linkage and \\nretention, and subsequently interrupt disease transmission. Disaggregation by age, sex, \\nmodality, and key population type can further identify subpopulations at higher risk to \\ninform program planning and implementation. Changes over time should be monitored to \\nassess program impact.  \\n• Program Implementation: The indicator may be used to monitor the rollout of testing for \\nrecent infection. A crude estimate of testing coverage may be calculated using: \\nHTS_RECENT by applicable age/sex bands divided by HTS_TST_POS by applicable \\nage/sex bands. Note that this proxy coverage estimate may exceed 100% in areas where \\nHIV testing is not directly supported by PEPFAR, however, recency testing coverage may \\nstill be monitored at sites where HTS results are available to assess program \\nimplementation and data quality. Tests for recent infection should be performed as a \\nsupplementary test for persons who are diagnosed with HIV-1 through the national HIV'),\n",

This means \\nthat HTS_RECENT should be reported by the clinical service partner (or equivalent) supporting \\nthe facility or community where the test for recent infection was performed. Partners supp orting \\nrecent infection surveillance, such as surveillance or laboratory partners, should share results \\nwith clinical service partners to facilitate programmatic follow-up and reporting. For example, if \\na facility sends specimens of persons who test recent to a laboratory to perform viral load \\ntesting to determine final RITA classification, those results should be shared with the clinical \\nservice partner (or equivalent) where the test for recent infection was performed.  \\n \\nElectronic case-based surveillance systems that incorporate RTRI and RITA results may be \\nused to collect and report data for this indicator. Where those systems do not exist or do not \\ninclude RTRI and RITA results, existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms that \\nhave been modified to incorporate RTRI results may be used.

HTS is recommended, but other service delivery points may be \\nconsidered if the test for recent infection is conducted within a short period of initial HIV \\ndiagnosis. Ideally, the test for recent infection should be conducted at the same t ime as \\ndiagnosis. Data for this indicator are collected and reported regardless of whether or not test \\nresults have been returned to the patient.  \\n \\nIf guidelines specify that viral load testing be conducted alongside the test for recent infection \\nas part of a RITA, then these results should be recorded in addition to the RTRI results. \\nBecause RITA results will take longer than RTRI, do not wait for RITA results to report the \\nRTRI results. RITA results should be included only during the same reporting period when the \\nRTRI was conducted. Any RITA results that are missing or delayed due to prolonged \\nturnaround time of VL testing should be outlined in the narrative. Viral load testing should be \\nincorporated at facilities/communities with ready access to viral load testing or sample referral \\nnetworks but is not required at facilities/communities that do not have this infrastructure in \\nplace. \\n \\nKey Populations:  \\nInformation on tests for recent infection should be reported by key population (PWID, MSM, \\nTG, FSW, and people in prison or other closed settings) where it is safe to collect this \\ninformation. \\n \\nSee Appendix A: Key Population Classification Document, to inform identification of key \\npopulations at HTS service delivery. Reporting of key population disaggregation should be \\nconsistent with what is described under the KP_PRE  “How to review for data quality” section \\non mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple key population categories (e.g., \\nFSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE key \\npopulation disaggregation category to avoid double-counting.  \\n \\nNote: Both key population-specific and clinical partners should complete these \\ndisaggregations, but only if it is safe to maintain these files and report. Age and sex data on \\nkey populations receiving tests for recent infection will not be reported. Please refer to the \\nKP_PREV indicator reference sheets for more information on working with key populations. \\nThe first priority of data collection and reporting of HTS_RECENT among key \\npopulations must be to do no harm. These data must be managed confidentially to ensure \\nthe identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination.  \\nHow to review for \\ndata quality: \\n• HTS_TST_POS (≥15 years) ≥ HTS_RECENT: The number of persons age ≥15 years who \\nreceived HIV testing services and received a positive result should be greater than or equal \\nto the number of persons who tested for recent infection.

This is often done in a \\nprivate setting, either alone or with a trusted person. HIV self-testing is a screening test \\nand requires self-testers with a reactive (preliminary positive) result to receive further testing \\nfrom a trained provider using a validated national testing algorithm. HIV self-testing \\napproaches range from unassisted self-testing (with limited or no instruction provided) to \\ndirectly assisted self-testing (where a testing provider demonstrates how to use the self-test \\nkit). Self-test kits can be distributed in various ways (i.e., by providers or outreach workers, \\nover-the-counter, etc.). Secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits may also occur (e.g., to \\npartners of ANC attendees, or clients of FSWs). \\n \\nThis indicator aims to monitor trends in the distribution of HIV self-test kits within a country \\nat the lowest distribution point (i.e., between the distributer and the intended \\nuser(s)/recipient). The implementation of HIV self-testing programs should facilitate and \\nenhance access to and uptake of HIV testing services for populations where HIV test \\nuptake is low and undiagnosed HIV infection is high (i.e., men, adolescents/young adults, \\nand key populations). \\nHow to collect:   The suggested data source is a (newly developed) HIVST (HIV self-test) register or \\nlogbook. This will minimize any potential confusion with HTS_TST data collection and \\nreporting since HIV self-testing is only a screening test and should not be reported under \\nHTS_TST which only includes diagnostic testing. If a standalone HIVST register or logbook \\nis not possible, revise existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms already in use \\nto include very clear labels to indicate self-testing to prevent information entered in an HTS \\nregister from being counted and reported under HTS_TST or HTS_TST_POS.  \\n \\nNote that one individual can receive multiple self-test kits (e.g., one for themselves and one \\nfor their partner or partners). Data for the numerator should be generated by counting \\nthe number of individual HIV self-test kits distributed and NOT the number of \\nindividuals receiving an HIV self-test kit. Number of self-test kits distributed should be \\ncaptured and reported at the lowest distribution point. The lowest distribution point refers to \\nthe individual/site giving out self-test kits and capturing data for monitoring purposes. This is \\nto prevent double counting between the various higher supply chain levels.  \\n \\nFor example, the central warehouse distributes 500 self-test kits to an implementing \\npartner doing outreach for KPs. The implementing partner gives their peer outreach workers \\na total of 50 self-test kits to give out during an outreach event. The outreach workers return \\nfrom their event having given out 30 self-test kits. In this scenario, the lowest distribution \\npoint would be the outreach workers who are capturing the monitoring data. Therefore, the \\nnumber of tests kits distributed would be 30. Each of these lowest distribution counts should \\nbe rolled up (aggregated) to create the numerator for this indicator.'),\n",

The findings can support national government and PEPFAR programs to \\nassess how efficient different distribution approaches are at reaching tar get populations. \\nThese data may also be useful for projecting programmatic commodities (e.g., self -test kits) \\nand systems needs (e.g., staffing resources). It is important to note that for the purposes of \\nthis indicator, it is assumed that the tests distributed to individuals and counted in the \\ndirectly assisted self-testing model are the used by individuals that received them so the \\ndisaggregation for “test kit distributed for use by” is not requested in the directly assisted \\nmodel. Please refer to the example clarification below for additional details. \\n \\nFor example, if an 18-year-old female reports to a testing site and receives a one-on-one \\ntesting demonstration for herself – the test for herself will be reported as directly assisted \\nand you would provide the age/sex disaggregation data for one test kit distributed in the 15-\\n19-year-old age band. When she leaves the clinic, she takes two additional test kits along \\nwith her: one for her sex partner and one for her friend to use at a later time. The two test  \\nkits for her sex partner and friend would be counted as unassisted. For the age/sex \\nbreakdown under unassisted, 2 tests would go in the 15-19-year-old female age band \\nbecause two tests were distributed to the female in that age band. The reporting follows \\nthe distribution of the test kits and not the age/sex demographics of the end user of \\nthe self-test kit. For the “test kit distributed for use by” disaggregate, you would indicate a \\n‘1’ in the ‘sex partner’ disaggregate for the test she planned to distribute to her sex partner \\nand a ‘1’ in the ‘other’ disaggregate for the test she planned to distribute to her friend. \\n \\nIt is understood that registers and procedures for HIVST are still relatively new in many \\nPEPFAR countries and specific distribution methods (e.g., vending machines) may not \\nalways allow for collection of detailed data on self-test kit distribution. As such, the only \\nrequired disaggregate for this indicator will be for the type of self-testing (i.e., directly-\\nassisted vs. unassisted). In addition, age/sex demographic information for test kits \\ndistributed using the directly-assisted self-testing model will also be required as these \\nindividuals should have received an in-person HIV test kit demonstration and demographic \\ninformation should be collected at that time \\n \\nNote: Although not required, implementing partners should attempt to document and report \\ninformation about actual use of self-test kits. This includes who used the test kit, the test \\nresult from the self-test and linkage to retesting (if result is reactive), particularly when \\ndirectly assisted HIVST occurs. Methods used may include request the return of the kits or \\nfollow up calls to determine outcomes. This information can further inform whether HIVST \\nservices are reaching individuals who may be HIV-positive and if those individuals are \\nretesting to confirm their diagnosis. \\n \\nFor more information on HIV self-testing, please refer to the “WHO Guidelines on HIV Self-\\nTesting and Partner Notification” released in December 2016. To review a repository of \\ncountry-specific guidance and polices related to HIV self-testing, please visit the HIV Self-\\nTesting Research and Policy Hub. \\nHow to review for data \\nquality: \\nData should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor \\nprogress towards achieving targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues. For \\nexample, the number of test kits distributed should not be greater than the number  of test \\nkits a provider allocated during the reporting period. Pay careful attention to the number of \\nHIVST kits distributed at pharmacies and online.  \\n \\nImplementing partners should review their data to ensure that HTS_SELF is not \\nreported under HTS_TST (or HTS_TST_POS) results. Furthermore, data should be \\nreviewed to ensure the numerator does not include the number of HIV self-tests performed'),\n",

For example, an HIV-positive rapid \\nHIV test performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, \\nwhich may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is \\nperformed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing partners to \\nconfirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator. The implementing partner who first \\nidentified and tested the individual should report on HTS_TST under the appropriate \\nmodality; however, that implementing partner must ensure that the diagnosis of the \\nindividual tested is confirmed. Only a confirmed diagnosis (positive or negative) counts \\nunder HTS_TST regardless of the modality used for reporting.

However, since diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is based on virologic and not \\nserologic tests, the general expectation is not to see results in the “< 1” disaggregate of the \\nHTS_INDEX indicator. HIV virologic testing of HIV-exposed infants should be counted \\nunder PMTCT_EID and PMTCT_HEI_POS. \\n \\nRetesting for verification of HIV positive status before or at antiretroviral (ART) initiation \\nshould not be counted under HTS_TST since testing of this individual will have already \\nbeen counted at the point of the initial diagnosis.

Therefore, retesting for verification should only be performed for \\npersons who have received an HIV diagnosis but have not yet been initiated on ART.

Another approach is to record information about prior testing on the \\nHTS client register. \\n3. For an individual to be counted under HTS_TST, their HIV diagnosis must be confirmed \\nusing a nationally validated testing algorithm. For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV \\ntest performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, \\nwhich may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test \\nis performed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing \\npartners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator. The implementing \\npartner who first identified and tested the individual should report on HTST_TST under \\nthe appropriate modality; however, that implementing partner must ensure that the \\ndiagnosis of the individual tested is confirmed. That is, only a confirmed diagnosis \\n(positive or negative) counts under HTS_TST regardless of the modality used for \\nreporting. Similarly, simply only confirming the diagnosis of an individual who has \\nalready been tested (as per the national testing algorithm) does not fulfill the \\nrequirements for reporting on HTS_TST regardless of the modality used. \\n4.

A single person should only be counted once under any given modality. \\n \\nService delivery modalities are defined as: \\n  \\nCommunity-based testing: Applies to any testing done outside of a designated health \\nfacility.

Index: Importantly, the index modality under HTS_TST will auto-populate from \\nHTS_INDEX (see HTS_INDEX reference sheet for more information). Index testing, \\nalso referred to as partner testing/partner notification services, is an approach whereby \\nthe exposed contacts (i.e., sexual partners, biological children and anyone with whom a \\nneedle was shared) of an HIV-positive person (i.e., index client), are elicited and offered \\nHIV testing services. That is, in this context, Index testing refers to any HIV testing of \\ncontacts of an index client (i.e., a known positive). Only the following persons count \\nas contacts: current or past sexual partner(s), biological children /parents (if \\nindex case is child) or anyone with whom a needle was shared. Biological \\nchildren reported under HTS_INDEX should only include children of an HIV-\\npositive mother and children of male-index clients (fathers) whose biological \\nmother is HIV-positive, deceased, or her HIV status is not known or not \\ndocumented. Conversely, if the index client is the child, his/her mother should be \\ntested, and if positive or deceased, the father should be tested as well. In this way, \\nprovision of index testing services is non-directional, whereby we are trying to follow \\ntransmission of the disease, and every newly identified positive becomes a subsequent \\nindex client from whom to elicit contacts. While testing the contacts of an index client \\nmay occur in mobile, VCT or other community testing venue, this testing should be \\nreported under HTS_INDEX.

Again, the index modality under HTS_TST will auto-populate \\nfrom HTS_INDEX (see HTS_INDEX reference sheet for more information). \\nB. Mobile: Testing in Mobile ad hoc or temporary testing locations, such as community \\ncenters, schools, workplaces, and includes testing in mobile unit such as tents and \\nvans. Testing related to VMMC services is not included here and should be reported \\nunder facility based VMMC modality.  \\nC. SNS (Social Network Strategies): Social network strategies are a set of distinct case-\\nfinding approaches that use individuals' (i.e. PLHIV or key populations) high -risk \\nnetwork connections to refer individuals for HIV testing. These approaches, which \\ninclude enhanced peer outreach approach (EPOA), leverage social, sexual, and drug -\\nusing relationships or behaviors to reach high risk and hidden individuals who may \\nbenefit from HIV testing that may otherwise not be captured under traditional testing \\nmodalities (e.g., VCT, PITC, or index testing).

If a named contact elicited via the index testing process \\nreturns with an SNS coupon the contact should be reported under index testing (either \\nfacility or community). For example, a newly diagnosed individual agrees to index \\ntesting services and shares information about Partner 1 and Partner 2. The provider \\nalso offers SNS and the index client agrees to recruit individuals in their network. \\nPartner 2 returns to the testing site and has a coupon that is used for SNS.

When the implementing partner \\ndetermines that the child is at risk of HIV infection, the program should refer children for testing \\nand counseling services. When the implementing partner knows the HIV status, the program \\nshould ensure that the children are linked to appropriate care and treatment services as an \\nessential element of quality case management. OVC programs should also play an important \\nrole in family-centered disclosure, for those who are living with HIV.  \\n \\nThe goal of monitoring OVC_HIVSTAT is to increase the proportion of children in the OVC \\nComprehensive program with a known HIV status or for whom an HIV test is not required \\nbased on a risk assessment. \\n• While OVC partners are encouraged to work with testing and clinical partners wherever \\npossible to confirm HIV and ART status, this indicator is NOT intended to be an indicator of \\nHIV tests performed or receipt of testing results, as these are measured elsewhere . \\n• This indicator is NOT intended to imply that all OVC require an HIV test. OVC with known \\npositive or negative status do not need to be tested. OVC with unknown HIV status should \\nbe assessed for risk, and if determined to be at risk, should be referred or otherwise \\nsupported, to access HTS. For younger children who are determined not to be at risk (“test \\nnot required based on risk assessment”), reassessment of risk will only be needed in cases \\nwhere their risk situation changes (i.e., in cases of child sexual abuse). Older children whom \\nthe IP thinks may be sexually active should be assessed every reporting period. An HIV risk \\nassessment should always occur prior to HIV testing to determine if a test is required.  \\n• Status disclosure to the implementing partner is NOT a prerequisite for enrollment or \\ncontinuation in an OVC program. OVC programs serve persons of positive, negative, and \\nunknown HIV status appropriate to their needs and vulnerability to HIV. This indicat or \\nensures that IPs are regularly providing outreach to caregivers to identify children’s HI  \\nstatus, encouraging family disclosure, and linking to care and treatment services as needed.'),\n",

Testing results \\nfor OVC who are referred for testing should be reported under HTS_TST based on the \\nservice delivery point where they are tested. \\n• This indicator also captures if implementing partners are tracking if the OVC that they serve \\nwho report to be living with HIV are successfully linked to and have continuity of treatment \\nand care. ART treatment status should be recorded both at the time of enrollment  as well as \\nat regular intervals at least once during the reporting period. \\n• Since this is not a testing indicator, HIV positivity yield should NOT be calculated based on \\nthis indicator. Yield calculations should only be made by testing partners.  \\n• A helpful way to assess O C_HI STAT performance is to create a “known status proxy” \\ncategory of known status/risk (by combining those reported positive, negative, and those \\nwho have been risk assessed and found to not require a test) and compare this with the \\nOVC_SER  <18 “O C Comprehensive” disaggregate. This analysis encourages programs \\nto actively follow-up on all instances of “HI  status unknown” by targeting instances of \\nmissing data, nondisclosure, and issues with reporting timing.  \\n• This indicator is a subset of the OVC_SERV Comprehensive program. Only OVC who were \\nreported under the O C_SER  <18 “O C Comprehensive” disaggregate should be \\nreported in the numerator for this indicator.  \\n• In previous MER iterations, DREAMS participants who were reported under OVC_SERV \\nwere reported under OVC_HIVSTAT where feasible. With the denominator change to \\ninclude only OVC Comprehensive program participants, do not count non-Comprehensive \\n(i.e. DREAMS or OVC Preventive) participants in the OVC_HIVSTAT numerator. \\nHow to collect:   Data sources for this indicator include HIV test results that are self-reported by OVC (or their \\ncaregivers), results of HIV Risk Assessments conducted by implementing partners, registers, \\nreferral forms, client records, or other confidential case management and program monitoring \\ntools that track those in treatment and care. Per COP Guidance, OVC and Clinical IPs should \\nwork together as multi-disciplinary teams, including by developing MOUs and data sharing \\nagreements, to ensure that children in need of an HIV test and/or HIV treatment are \\nappropriately served.  \\n \\nImplementation of the HIV risk assessment should be integrated into case management and \\non-going case monitoring, and should not be conducted separately, if possible. This will vary \\nby partner and project. The partners should work out a timeline based on their experience of \\nhow long referral completion and status disclosure usually takes and factor that into their case \\nmanagement processes.  \\n \\nImplementing partners will record the OVC’s self-reported HIV status semi-annually. \\n \\nReporting Scenarios: \\nQ1: Daniel reports to the community health worker (CHW) that he is negative, but his last test \\nwas two y ars ago. Is Dani   sti   r port d as “N gativ ”, or as “No Stat s”, and n  ds to b  \\nrisk assessed?  \\n \\nA1: Based on their knowledge of the child from case management records, if the CHW \\nbelieves that the child has no risk of HIV infection (i.e., no one in the household is HIV+, they \\nare not exposed to violence, child is not sexually active yet) then getting another test done is \\nnot necessary and would report them as “Negative”. This applies mainly to younger children \\nunder age 12 (depends on average age of sexual debut in the country). For adolescents, we \\nrecommend getting risk assessed if the test was not conducted in the reporting period. \\n \\nIn that same scenario, what if the CHW decides to administer the HIV Risk Assessment to \\nDaniel and finds that an HIV test is not indicated, how should that be reported? This should be \\nreported as “Test Not Required Based on Risk Assessment” because once the CHW decides \\nto conduct a risk assessment, this means that the child’s status is in question and should be \\nreported accordingly.'),\n",

If \\nfound at risk (e.g., GBV exposure) then she should be referred for testing. If determined to be \\n“Test Not Required Based on Risk Assessment” Elizabeth would be captured as “Test Not \\nRequired Based on Risk Assessment”.  \\n \\nIf she completes the testing within the reporting period and the caregiver is willing to disclose \\nthe result of the test, her response would be captured accordingly. \\nIf she is risk assessed and referred for testing, but her caregiver is not able/willing to complete \\nthe test or disclose the status within the reporting period it is captured as “No HI  Status”. \\nHopefully by the following reporting period, the caregiver will have completed the referral and \\ndisclosed the child\\'s status so it can be captured as positive or negative.

HIV status and completion of an HIV test are not required \\nfor enrollment in an OVC program. If a child is believed to be at high risk of HIV and the \\ncaregiver is reluctant to disclose results or complete a test, OVC programs should attempt to \\nfacilitate a meeting with the caregiver, and persons specially trained on HIV disclosure. OVC \\nprograms may also consider enlisting the support of community members with whom the \\ncaregiver has greater trust. Until the client chooses to disclose test results, status under \\nO C_HI STAT should be recorded as “No HI  Status.” \\n \\nQ4: How do we report on HIV exposed infants who are still too young to have had their final \\nHIV status testing? \\n \\nA4: Because HIV-exposed infants may be tested at multiple points prior to receiving a final \\nHIV status, we recommend that they be counted as \"no status\" until such time that the clinic \\ndetermines their final status as positive (infected) or negative (not infected). A note can be \\nentered in DATIM in the narrative section indicating the number of children entered as \"no \\nstatus\" that are HIV-exposed (i.e., infants during the reporting period who were of \\nundetermined status). It is important for all HIV-exposed infants and their caregivers to be \\nfacilitated to make appointments deemed necessary by the clinic.  \\n \\nQ5: Jane is an 11-year-old AGYW enrolled in DREAMS, and one of the DREAMS services \\nshe receives is also an eligible OVC service.

Review of outlier percentages for testing \\ncoverage by age band is recommended (e.g., review high and low outliers for 0-≤2-month \\ntesting coverage disaggregate). \\n \\nAssumption: the total number of HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women, and \\ntherefore HEI, does not significantly vary quarter by quarter.

See “How to Review for Data Quality” for more information. \\nHow to collect:   This indicator should be collected from the clinical source (i.e., HIV-exposed infant registers \\nor patient records) to ensure unduplicated patient counting and patient care. HIV -exposed \\ninfant registers should be used to count HIV-infected infants whose results were returned in \\nthe reporting period and the age at the time of sample collection.

Additional supporting information for this \\nindicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (i.e., DNA PCR or \\nPOC/near POC log books or electronic systems) however, it will be important to ensure that \\nrepeat tests of the same sample or HIV-infected infants receiving a confirmatory virologic \\nHIV test result are not counted twice. Please note that PMTCT_HEI_POS should include all \\nHIV-positive infants identified at the facility in the quarter, regardless of entry point (i.e., not \\njust those identified through the PMTCT entry point). Therefore, a PMTCT clinic may need \\nto compile testing data from other entry points at the facility (e.g., inpatient wards, \\nmalnutrition program) to report accurately and completely on this indicator. \\n \\nOnly HIV-infected infants identified as infected by a virologic HIV test on a sample collected \\nwhen they were between ages 0 through 12 months should be included in this indicator. \\nInfants who initially were identified negative from a first virologic test but who were later \\nidentified as HIV-infected after a later virologic test should be included, as long as the infant \\nwas still aged 12 months or less at the time of sample collection. Currently, the most \\ncommonly used form of virologic testing or nucleic acid testing (“NAT”) is HI  DNA PCR on \\ndried blood spots (DBS) but this indicator also includes HIV-infected infants identified \\nthrough POC testing (e.g., Alere, Xpert).

An HIV-infected infant reported as “ART initiation \\nconfirmed” should have documentation of an ART regimen in their record. An HI -infected \\ninfant whose record includes documentation of “referred to ART” or an ART clinic number \\nwithout evidence of receipt of an ART regimen should not be reported as “ART initiation \\nconfirmed.” ART does not include infant ARV prophylaxis regimens for PMTCT. \\nHow to review for data \\nquality: \\nLinkage and ART Initiation:  \\n• Compare the PMTCT_HEI_POS ART initiation confirmed (disaggregate) to the \\nPMTCT_ HEI_POS numerator to calculate linkage to ART. Significantly <100% or \\n>100% linkage of HIV-infected infants to ART may reflect referrals to different sites, \\nprogram weakness, or poor data quality and requires review to confirm. \\n• TX_NEW comparison: HEI_POS_ART disaggregate is expected to be close in value to \\nTX_NEW age <1; however, some discrepancies could be expected and significant \\ndiscrepancies should be reviewed to confirm. These values may differ in part because \\nthe age disaggregate definitions for these indicators differs. TX_NEW age is based on \\nage at ART initiation, while PMTCT_HEI_POS is based on age at virologic sample \\ncollection. Scenario: An infant’s virologic sample was collected when the infant was 11 \\nmonths old near the end of Q1. The infant’s positive result was available to the site in \\nQ2 and she started ART in Q2 at 13 months of age. Under PMTCT_HEI_POS in Q2, \\nshe would be reported as “Positive, ART initiation confirmed, age 2-12mo;” however, \\nunder TX_NEW in Q2 she would be reported in the 1-9-year age group.  \\nProxy positivity: it is useful to review proxy positivity (PMTCT_HEI_POS / PMTCT_EID) \\nacross sites or locations to identify potential outliers for further review. Summing multiple \\nquarters of data is recommended, as quarter-specific comparisons may provide a less \\naccurate proxy. See “How to use” section for more considerations. \\nHow to calculate \\nannual total: Sum results across quarters. \\nDisaggregations: Numerator Disaggregations: \\nDisaggregate Groups Disaggregates \\nInfant age at virologic \\nsample collection, for \\npositive infants \\n[Required] \\n• Positive, 0 to ≤2 months \\n• Positive, 2 to 12 months \\nPositive, confirmed initiated \\nART by age at virologic \\nsample collection \\n[Required] \\n• Positive, confirmed initiated ART, 0-2 months of age \\n• Positive, confirmed initiated ART, 2-12 months \\nDenominator Disaggregations: \\nDisaggregate Groups Disaggregates \\nN/A N/A'),\n",

There is a risk of double counting, as a pregnant woman \\nreceiving ART at ANC should have multiple visits for each pregnancy. Therefore partners \\nshould ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double \\ncounting of the same pregnant woman across visits including a paper based longitudinal \\nANC or PMTCT register (meaning a register that is able to record all information about 1 \\npregnancy in one location, with rows or columns that allow for recording information on \\nmultiple visits during that pregnancy) or an electronic medical record/patient tracking \\nsystem. There is also a risk of undercounting if those women who are already on ART prior \\nto attending ANC are not documented, therefore the ANC register should document both \\n“New on ART” and “Already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy”. \\n \\nNote: Those women reported in PMTCT_ART including newly enrolled on ART and already \\non ART at the beginning of pregnancy should also be reported in the TX_NEW and \\nTX_CURR indicators, respectively. Women who are already on ART should not be counted \\nin TX_NEW. PMTCT_ART is about initiation of ART (yes/no) or already on ART (yes/no). \\nThis will most likely be captured at ANC1 but may be captured at a future ANC visit. \\nWomen initiated on ART during L&D or breastfeeding should not be reported under \\nPMTCT_ART but should still be reported under TX_NEW. \\nHow to review for data \\nquality: \\nReview any site with over 100% coverage or very low coverage to ensure they reflect \\nexpected results. In general, services should be reported at the site where they are \\ndelivered (however PMTCT_ART- “already on treatment” and PMTCT_STAT_POS “known \\npositive at entry” are exceptions, see details under description of disaggregate below). \\nTherefore, coverage at site level must be understood within the context of the service \\ndelivery model at that site. For example, in local areas where ART is integrated into ANC \\nand low volume PMTCT sites are only testing for HIV and then referring women to other \\nfacilities for ART, the expectation is that for one individual PMTCT_STAT_POS (newly \\ntested) will be documented at one facility and PMTCT_ART (new on ART) would be \\ndocumented at another facility leading to the appearance of greater than >100% coverage \\nat one site and 0% coverage at another. \\nHow to calculate \\nannual total: \\nSum results across quarters for both the numerator and denominator.'),\n",

Patients should also be reported as IIT if they have \\nbeen traced and scheduled to return after the end of the reporting period (in other words, \\nthey have not returned yet).

It is assumed that tracing will be attempted for \\nevery patient who has missed clinical visits at both <28 days and >28 days since the last \\nexpected clinical contact or ARV pick-up. \\n \\nThis indicator seeks to reconcile the status of patients who are TX_CURR during the \\nreporting period and then fall off of ART, i.e., into the classification of >28 day since clinical \\ncontact or ARV pick-up status DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. This includes those \\nART patients who continue treatment from the prior reporting period (TX_CURR at the \\nbeginning of the reporting period), and those who newly initiate in this reporting period \\n(TX_NEW). To reiterate, this indicator should not count or report those patients who were \\nalready lost and not counted in TX_CURR at the beginning of the reporting period.  \\n \\nIf a patient is re-engaged and restarted ART after >28 days of being off treatment, and \\nremains on treatment until the end of the reporting period, then the patient should be added \\nback to TX_CURR, but should not be counted in TX_ML.

Facilities should make every attempt to \\ncontinue to contact persons who experienced IIT from a prior reporting period and return \\nthem to care, an outcome which would be reflected in the TX_RTT indicator.  \\n \\nNote that TX_ML requires that a patient is on treatment at the beginning of the reporting \\nperiod or newly initiates treatment during the reporting period, while TX_RTT requires t hat a \\npatient is not on treatment at the beginning of the reporting period and excludes patients \\nwho newly initiate treatment during the reporting period. Therefore, a patient cannot be \\ncounted in TX_ML and TX_RTT in the same reporting period.  \\n \\nBoth TX_ML and TX_RTT have disaggregates on interruption in treatment. The TX_ML IIT \\ndisaggregate reflects the amount of time that a patient was on treatment when they \\nexperienced an interruption in treatment. The TX_RTT IIT disaggregate reflects the duration \\nof interruption in treatment prior to being returned to treatment.  \\n \\nSee Appendix J for a visual representation of TX_CURR, TX_ML, TX_NEW, and TX_RTT.  \\nIt is widely acknowledged that even where reporting is required, mortality data, especially \\ncause of death, are often underreported or inaccurate.

Additionally, a patient should not have been counted under TX_CURR in \\nthe previous reporting period. The reason for not being counted under TX_CURR in the \\nprevious reporting period could include having experienced IIT in the previous reporting \\nperiod, having experienced IIT at an earlier time point, or having stopped/refused treatment.  \\n \\nA newly initiated patient who experiences IIT and is returned to treatment within the same \\nreporting period should not be counted in TX_RTT.

This allows ART prog rams \\nto monitor individual and overall programmatic response to ART as measured by virologic \\nsuppression. This indicator will provide data on patients who have a viral load (VL) test in \\nthe past 12 months and the percentage who were virally suppressed at the most recent \\ntest. \\n \\nVL TESTING COVERAGE: \\nComparison of the denominator for this indicator with the result for TX_CURR from 6 \\nmonths earlier (i.e., two quarters prior) can be used to crudely estimate VL testing coverage \\nsupported by PEPFAR. For example, a comparison may be made between the FY20 Q1 \\ndenominator for TX_PVLS and FY19 Q3 TX_CURR, given that patients newly initiating ART \\nand included in TX_CURR in FY19 Q4 and FY20 Q1 may not be eligible for a viral load test. \\nIn calculating this estimate, it is important to ensure that individuals, not tests are being \\nreported for TX_PVLS. VL testing coverage for pregnant women can be estimated by \\ncomparing the TX_PVLS denominator “Pregnant” disaggregate to the sum of the last four \\nquarters of PMTCT_ART “Already on ART” disaggregate. This coverage calculation may \\nunderestimate the number of pregnant women that need a viral load test as it does not \\ninclude pregnant women newly initiating ART. When country level guidance indicates a viral \\nload test for pregnant women newly initiating ART, the coverage denominator should \\ninclude both PMTCT_ART “New on ART” and PMTCT_ART “Already on ART”. \\n \\nAnalyzing both VL testing coverage and suppression rates by geography, sub-population, \\nand implementing mechanisms is essential for program management and quality of care. \\nReal-time review of VL results should trigger an immediate response to follow -up on \\npatients who are not suppressed (i.e., VL ≥1000). \\nHow to collect:   This indicator should be collected from clinical sources (e.g., electronic or paper patient \\nrecords), where possible, to ensure de-duplicated patient counting and receipt of results to \\ninform patient care. Ideally, data for this indicator should be collected from an electronic \\nmedical records system (EMR) to minimize data collection errors and ensure that results \\nare informing patient care. If data collection from an EMR is not possible, indicator data may \\nbe collected from paper-based registers or reports that reflect the VL results.

Timely access to up -to-date \\npatient information plays a vital role in the provision of effective clinical care by health \\nprofessionals. Diagnosis and treatment can be improved if health professionals have easy \\naccess to accurate and comprehensive medical records of patients. \\nHow to collect:   Definition of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR):  \\nAn EMR is a longitudinal electronic record of an individual patient's health information that \\ncan assist health professionals with decision-making and treatment. Data found in a record \\nmay include patient demographics, past medical history, vital signs, examination and \\nprogress notes, medications, allergies, immunizations, laboratory test results, other test \\nresults. It can also support the collection of data for other uses such as quality \\nmanagement, public health disease surveillance and reporting. EMR can include real-time \\npoint-of-care data entry as well as retrospective data entry. An EMR is a digital version of a \\npaper chart that contains key information in a patient’s medical history from one service \\ndelivery point or site.  \\n \\nThe implementing partner should indicate whether the PEPFAR-supported service delivery \\nareas have implemented and are actively using an electronic medical record system to \\nassist clinical service provision or patient/program monitoring and reporting. Specifically, for \\nPEPFAR reporting a minimum of 6 months of retrospective data should be included in the \\nEMR. (For example, an ART EMR set up in September 2018 to contain at least 6 months of \\nretrospective data (current patients that have been enrolled on ART) could be counted in \\nthe reporting at FY18 APR.  \\n \\nIndividual service delivery area/point EMR versus Integrated Health EMR:  \\nEMRs are typically for all health areas, but PEPFAR is interested in better understanding \\nwhether EMRs are available for the service delivery areas where PEPFAR focuses its work. \\nIf a service delivery area is incorporated in a larger integrated health EMR, then it should be \\nincluded this indicator. If two or more service areas are in an integrated EMR, both areas \\nshould be included in this indicator. A site service delivery area should be reported under \\nthis indicator if the EMR is on site (i.e., server and computer entry screen or there is a \\ncentral server at a hub facility, that includes all data from all the “spokes” for that facility’s \\ncatchment area. As long as the data for patient management and reporting comes from the \\nEMR system as one source.\"),\n",

The lack of a sufficient workforce in countries presents a serious \\nchallenge to every area of health.  The data will tell us the number of new health workers \\nwho are available to enter the health workforce each year as a result of PEPFAR support.  \\nHow to collect:   Training under this indicator is defined as “pre-service” training – the training of “new” health \\nworkers (see definition below). Training generally occurs prior to the individual entering the \\nhealth workforce in his or her new position (with the exception of certain training that may \\noccur on-the job but that prepares health workers to function as a new cadre or with an \\nexpanded scope of practice in the health system). A health worker who advances to a \\nhigher cadre (e.g., a clinical assistant who completes training to become a clinical officer) \\nshall be counted as a “new” health worker for the purposes of this indicator. The HRH goal \\nis to expand the number of workers in the workforce and increase access to care through \\nthe advancement of current workers to higher level cadres through additional training and \\neducation.  \\n \\nPre-service training institutions are university-based or affiliated schools of medicine, \\nnursing, public health, social work, laboratory science, pharmacy, and other health -related \\nfields. Non-professional or paraprofessional training would be any accredited and nationally \\nrecognized pre-service program that is a requirement for this cadre’s entry into the \\nworkforce.  \\n \\n“In-service” and “continuing education” training should not be included in the count for this \\nindicator but continue to be encouraged. These types of training may be captured by other \\nindicators within program areas (e.g., supply chain).  \\n \\nIn order to count, the duration of training must meet or exceed a minimum of 6 months. For \\nexample, community health workers who receive a 3-month training course cannot be \\ncounted here. The training duration may be a combination of classroom and practical field \\ntime to arrive at six months.  \\n \\nA pre-service training program must be nationally accredited, or at the minimum meet \\nnational and international standards.

To ensure people living with HIV receive the \\ncare and treatment required to live healthy, productive lives, and to reduce the chance of \\ntransmitting HIV, it is critical that they know their status.

The \\nnumber of deaths among PLHIV must be subtracted from the cumulative number \\ndiagnosed to calculate the number of people living with HIV who know their status.  \\n• Survey-based reporting: \\no Certain population-based surveys include questions about known HV status. \\nAlthough this information may be subject to under-reporting bias, when \\ncombined with survey-related HIV testing it can provide an estimate of known \\nstatus among survey respondents. \\no Many population-based surveys include questions on HIV testing history. These \\nquestions can provide a range for the proportion of PLHIV with known status. \\nThe percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who have been tested in \\nthe past 12 months and received the results provides the upper range of known \\nstatus (there will be a small proportion equal to the annual incidence rate – less \\nthan 2% in most cases – of people who might have converted in the 12 months \\nafter being tested). The percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who \\nhave ever been tested and received the results provides the lower range of \\nknown status. \\no When using survey-based methods, note that:  \\n▪ Household surveys are often restricted to respondents of reproductive age \\n(15– 49), and so may not be representative of people living with HIV <15 \\nyears and >49 years. \\n▪ Because household surveys are typically only done every five years, data \\nfrom non-recent surveys may not reflect current levels of testing coverage. \\nDisaggregations: Numerator Disaggregations: \\nDisaggregate Groups Disaggregates \\nAge/Sex \\n[Required] \\n• <15 F/M, 15+ F/M \\nSex-Only \\n[Conditional, if age/sex \\nreporting is not possible] \\n• Female \\n• Male'),\n",

This tool was developed in collaboration with \\nWHO, UNAIDS, the Global Fund, and PEPFAR to ensure that there is one agreed upon methodology for \\nconducting data quality assessments of treatment numbers. For more information, tools, and examples: \\nplease visit the following link: https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/toolkits/hiv-data-quality-assessment/en/ \\n \\nThe objectives of DQA are: \\n1) to assess the quality of reported data by using standard indicator definitions to recreate the reported \\nnumbers for selected indicators and compare with the numbers reported by the national data collection \\nsystem, such as DHIS2 (District Health Information Software), and by partners; \\n2) to verify the quality of and to improve the reported HIV patient monitoring data and systems at the \\nfacility level; \\n3) to cross-validate a sample of patient records and manually count patient records and describe any \\nsystematic data quality challenges with applied indicator definitions and data recording and to \\nrecommend actions to improve data quality; \\n4) to determine the percentage of people receiving ART nationally over- or undercounted (and sub-\\nnationally when feasible or the country needs this) and use this to reset the numbers at both the site \\nlevel and within the national data collection system in addition to ensuring accurate reporting in any \\nreporting systems moving forward; and \\n5) to update national reporting data and national epidemiological estimates for improved planning. \\n \\nThe DQA requires six steps: \\n1) Setting up a country-based implementation team of stakeholders to agree on the scope and methods \\nand to support the implementation and dissemination of the results of the DQA; \\n2) To agree on the sampling required and the indicators to include in the assessment and to finalize the \\nsite-level instruments; \\n3) Assessing at the site level to collect data, including assessing the HIV patient monitoring system and \\nrecreating the numbers of people receiving and initiating ART; \\n4) Conducting a desk review to identify challenges in national reporting (can take place simultaneously \\nwith step 3); \\n5) Analyzing the results and resetting the site-level and national numbers of people receiving and \\ninitiating ART; and \\n6) Developing a communication strategy and disseminating the updated values. \\n \\nA two-stage phased approach for implementing a DQA is recommended to assist countries in giving priority to \\nscaling up DQA activities over time and to prepare countries to implement larger-scale DQA when significant \\ndata quality issues are identified or when the country needs or wants to review and adjust treatment data at \\nthe subnational level. \\nThe scope of the two phases is as follows. \\n• Phase 1: in the initial phase, the DQA will be implemented within a nationally representative number of \\nART sites in which the six steps indicated above will be implemented with a view to validate the \\nnumber of people on ART and if necessary reset the national ART number as needed, as well as \\nstrengthen the overall HIV patient monitoring system. \\n \\n• Phase 2: implementation of the second phase DQA is in response to identified DQA challenges in the \\nphase 1 DQA which warrant further investigation and review of HIV treatment data in a larger number \\nof ART sites or within the context of implementing a DQA strategy in which DQA activities are scaled \\nup over time. Countries completing the first phase of DQA and finding a verification factor \\n(recreated/reported times 100) of less than 90% or greater than 110% within the sample should \\ntransition to the second phase in which the exercise is expanded to additional ART sites for an overall \\nrepresentation of 80% of the people currently receiving ART for the reporting period being reviewed.'),\n",

This second \\nphase can be conducted by the Ministry of Health and implementing partners with site staff. \\n \\nIn addition, with larger site sample sizes, countries can also consider analyzing and adjusting \\nsubnational ART data based on country need and interest in this phase. \\n \\nDQA Step 1: Set up a multi-stakeholder implementation team  \\nInstitutionalizing routine assessment and monitoring of the quality of reported data is an integral part of an \\neffective HIV program. Data quality is especially important given the use of this data to plan for program \\nimplementation, the use of global resources and to affirm progress towards epidemic control. As such it is \\ncritical there is full ownership and support for DQA from Ministries of Health and partners. Within this context, \\nthe specific roles and responsibilities of country stakeholders are detailed below. \\nBefore starting any data collection or review processes, the Ministry of Health and the country team will inform \\nother national and local authorities, such as the district health office, of this assessment and engage them, \\nseeking their involvement in the data validation activities and other subsequent activities to improve data \\nquality. \\nRoles and responsibilities \\n• Ministries of Health: Ministries of Health are responsible for leading the implementation and overall \\ncoordination of the DQA in collaboration with partners, including PEPFAR, the Global Fund, WHO and \\nUNAIDS. \\n \\n• WHO: WHO will coordinate changes to the guidance on DQA to ensure consistency in implementation \\nacross all partners. In addition, WHO will provide technical support to Ministries of Health for \\nimplementation and convene stakeholders to support the Ministry of Health on using the results and \\ndata and improving the system as necessary. \\n \\n• PEPFAR: PEPFAR headquarters staff will provide technical assistance to interagency country teams \\nfor the development of their specific DQA protocols. In addition, some in-person technical support will \\nbe provided from PEPFAR headquarters staff. \\n \\nPEPFAR field staff from each of the PEPFAR-supported agencies (such as the United States Centers \\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, United States Agency for International Development and \\nDepartment of Defense) are required to participate in planning and implementation of the DQA. \\nPEPFAR field teams should work within the interagency country team to select sites from all ART sites \\nin the country and draft the DQA schedule, draft notification letters to relevant stakeholders and notify \\nimplementing partners and site staff before DQA visits. PEPFAR field staff should also participate in \\ndeveloping the final DQA report and remediation plan and should ensure that implementing partners \\nand sites receive additional technical assistance and remediation, as necessary. Lastly, PEPFAR field \\nstaff should coordinate with Ministries of Health to ensure that divergent numbers identified in \\nPEPFAR-supported sites are corrected in the health ministry reporting system and are reported \\ncorrectly at the next PEPFAR quarterly reporting cycle. \\n \\n• Global Fund: The Technical Advice and Partnerships Department of the Global Fund Secretariat will \\nwork closely with the country teams for respective countries to support the implementation of DQA and \\nthe use of the findings for programs. \\nThe Global Fund will also provide funding and technical assistance for implementing DQA by \\nmobilizing technical resources in the monitoring and evaluation technical assistance pool, local Global \\nFund agents and quality assurance providers for health facility assessments and data quality reviews. \\nThe Global Fund country teams will coordinate with national AIDS programs and in-country partners to \\nensure that the correct national numbers are used for quantifying ARV drugs, laboratory reagents and \\nkey performance indicators.'),\n",

In \\nimplementing the sampling approach, the following steps are followed. \\nI. Create a sampling frame: a list of all ART sites nationally. In the second phase of DQA, countries may \\nconsider disaggregating this list by subnational unit (such as region or district). The sample frame \\nshould include the following information:  \\na. Site name and location, such as province, district, etc.; \\nb. The number of people currently receiving ART in the past calendar year – to validate the \\nprimary indicator of currently receiving ART; \\nc. The number of new ART initiators in the most recent reporting time frame (such as quarter or \\nyear) – to validate the indicator of new ART initiators; \\nd. Domains (such as PEPFAR support, Global Fund support, etc.); and \\ne. Any additional strata of interest (such as facility type, paper versus electronic, etc.). \\nII. Decide on the number of ART sites to be sampled nationally and by strata in phase 1. This is a country \\ndecision usually based on the objectives of the DQA, feasibility, cost and whether the objective is to \\ndevelop a correction factor, achieving an acceptable relative margin of error at the national and \\nsubnational levels and within specific strata of interest. The interorganizational country team should \\ndetermine the appropriate sample size based on country priorities for the specific objectives of the \\nDQA and precision of the desired estimates, available resources, feasibility and time considerations. \\nCountries may assess data quality in a limited sample of sites to obtain understanding of data quality \\nissues to determine whether a correction factor is needed or sites with 80% of the people receiving \\nART should have their numbers of people receiving ART reset. However, a relative margin of error of \\n10% for a 90% confidence interval is recommended as a minimum level of acceptable precision for the \\nnational correction factor for the number of people receiving ART (see subsection 3.5). \\nIII. ART sites should be selected for the assessment by probability sampling, such as simple random \\nsampling, stratified random sampling, systematic random sampling or probability proportional to size \\nsampling, in which size would be based on the number of people facilities reported to be receiving \\ntreatment. To obtain a national correction factor, a qualified statistician should perform the sampling of \\nsites and the country team should archive all the programs and/or tools used to select the sites, \\nspecifically the sampling frame, site selection probabilities and relevant design information, since \\ncertain designs require the use of sampling weights during the analysis phase. \\nIV. Some countries may have sites that are very small (such as fewer than 100 people receiving ART) or \\nmay be difficult to access because of geographical remoteness or political instability. In these cases, \\nthe interorganizational country team may consider excluding some or all of these sites from the \\nevaluation because of logistical considerations. In general, if these sites represent less than 10% of \\nthe population receiving ART in the country, countries may choose to exclude these clinics from the \\nsampling frame.

These sites \\ncan be included in the second phase of DQA. \\n \\nDQA Step 3. Site-level assessment \\nI. Site-assessment: For this activity in both phases 1 and 2, the interorganizational country team uses \\nstandardized processes to review existing information on people receiving ART that is routinely \\ncollected through facility- or community-based patient monitoring systems and site assessment tools. \\nDQA activities use a set of standardized tools and data collection instruments (see the annexes) \\ndeveloped specifically for the treatment indicators, although these may be adapted to fit local contexts \\nor to accommodate additional indicators. Data quality should be assessed at the sites for both \\ntreatment indicators (number of people currently receiving ART and number of people initiating ART) \\ndisaggregated by age and sex. \\n \\nSelected facilities will be contacted to identify a date and time for the DQA visit. Countries may use \\ntheir own template for notifying the sites of the visit and should include the following information: the \\npurpose of the visit, proposed visit dates and a request for key staff to be present for the visit. \\n \\nThe site-level assessment visit will consist, at minimum, of the following activities: \\n• Introductory discussions with key staff of the site and implementing partners; \\n• Review and completion of informed consent; \\n• Review and completion of the patient monitoring system checklist; \\n• Site walk-through and assessment of record systems to determine patient and data flow from \\nthe point of initial data capture (patient files) to data aggregation and reporting (registers and \\nmonthly aggregate tools) and to identify gaps and opportunities to improve data quality; \\n• Recount of reported numbers for selected indicators disaggregated by age and sex and \\ncomparison against the numbers reported to the Ministry of Health routinely as well as \\nPEPFAR, for example in DHIS2 and DATIM (Data for Accountability, Transparency and \\nImpact Monitoring), which may include reviewing paper charts, registers, EMR systems, \\npharmacy records or other record systems; \\n• Cross-validation of a sample of paper charts, registers, EMR systems, pharmacy records or \\nother record systems; depending on the result, a physical count using patient charts should \\nbe conducted if needed; and \\n• Outbrief with key site and implementing partner staff to summarize key findings from the visit.  \\nPast experience with implementing DQA in countries indicates that one site per day on average is \\nfeasible for completing these activities. In terms of human resource, cost and time requirements, this \\nvaries significantly according to the number of facilities sampled and patient files reviewed as well as \\nthe geographical distribution of facilities and country context. As broad guidance, however, a recent \\nexercise implemented in 84 facilities required a team of 31 data collectors and supervisors over 25 \\ndays and 24 data entry clerks over 20 days. \\nII. Data collection and analysis: To assure the quality of collected data for review interorganizational \\ncountry teams are expected to apply standard data quality assurance practices during data collection. \\nThis includes double data entry when possible or having two teams enter a sample of the data to \\ncheck the quality. At the least, data capture will be conducted in pairs with one partner monitoring the \\ndata entry of the other. This will ensure that the data collection team is not introducing any error during \\nthe review process. The process for each activity is outlined below. \\n \\nPrimary activity (required): \\nRecreating selected indicators and validating the report: \\na. Site staff members first describe the site’s data systems, reporting process and methods for \\ncalculating each indicator during the discussions. \\nb. The assessment team calculates the selected indicators according to the current definitions, \\nattempting to replicate the procedures used by each site to aggregate and report quarterly \\ntotals. If sites report the indicator using a definition that differs from the standard definition, this \\nalternative definition will be known as the site definition and will be documented using the site'),\n",

The reporting and site method for the indicator should be used when recreating \\nthe reported number. However, if time and other constraints are present, recreating the \\nstandard definition is the priority activity. \\nc. The recreation of the selected indicators should use the same data source the sites use to \\nreport the indicator. For instance, if the sites use the ART register to report the number of \\npeople currently receiving ART, the recreation should also use the ART register. Some sites \\nmay use the patient charts or other data sources, such as ARV drug pick-up records to report \\non the number of people currently receiving ART. If this is the case, the recreation should be \\nbased on the tools used by the site for reporting. \\nd. This recreation may include computing patient tallies and confirming results from facility \\nregisters, patient databases, pharmacy logs and laboratory records and should review the \\nmost recently reported data. \\ni. When recreating indicators in facilities with an electronic database, and where \\nindicators were calculated by the site using that electronic system, ask the site staff or \\ndatabase manager for the software report or query used to run the calculations, and \\nvalidate the consistency of that query with partner and/or Ministry of Health definitions \\nfor the respective indicator, when possible. Reports are often routine and so definitions \\nand queries used at sites will often be the same across sites using the same electronic \\nsystems. \\nii. A random sample of inactive patient charts (such as 10 charts) should be selected and \\nreviewed to assess misclassification and determine how many may actually still be \\nactive. If this review identifies issues with the classification of inactive patient charts, \\nphysically counting patient charts should be considered (as described in the section on \\nother data validation activities). \\ne. The assessment team then compares the calculated results from the reported and site (if this \\nexists) method recreation with the reported value and discuss differences (if any). The \\nmeasure for comparison will be the verification factor (recreated/reported times 100) and \\nconfidence interval, which explains how much of the reported data can be verified. A \\nverification factor within 90% to 110% is within acceptable levels but should still be recorded, \\nreported and reviewed by the Ministry of Health and country team to adjust national ART data. \\nf. Discrepancies between the reported and recreated values (percentage difference) are \\ncomputed, described and discussed with each site. To the extent possible, the reasons for \\npossible differences between the values computed during the site visit and the values reported \\nby that site are further investigated and described (see other data validation activities for the \\ndetails of methods that can be used). If immediate remediation is needed, action plans should \\nbe developed with the sites and options for correcting the data should be discussed.  \\n \\nTo support the primary data validation activity and implement the final step of assessing the \\ndiscrepancies between reported and recalculated ART numbers, at least one of the data validation \\nactivities below should be conducted alongside the DQA. These activities will inform the DQA by \\nproviding additional information on the completeness and accuracy of the data sources and reporting \\ntools. \\n \\nOther data validation activities: \\n1. Site-level cross-validation: the process of checking the completeness and accuracy of site level \\nsource documents by cross-referencing identified data elements in routine reporting source \\ndocuments (typically patient charts) with other reporting documents, such as the ART register, \\npharmacy records or EMR system. \\na. The assessment team randomly samples a number of patient charts from the ART \\nregister beginning with the start of the time period being reviewed. Assessment teams \\nshould define the number of charts to be selected and the specific sampling method \\n(such as every fifth person) during the planning stages of the assessment.  \\nb.

A random sample of charts may be selected to estimate the completeness and \\naccuracy with a high degree of statistical precision (narrow confidence interval). \\nThis often requires a larger sample size and can be calculated using a sample \\nsize calculator.

The data collected will be used to calculate the percentage of discordance between the \\nsource document (patient charts) and other data from reporting tools such as the \\npharmacy system, EMRs and/or ART register. \\ne. For this activity, teams have access to patient records and charts or personally \\nidentifying health information, and the teams therefore apply a standardized practice to \\ndata extraction, making sure to cover the name, age, address and phone number of \\neach patient. The patient identifiers such as name, date of birth and sex are used to \\nidentify the records for this activity, confirming the same patient across different data \\nsources. These identifiers are not removed from the facility and are not part of the data \\ncollected. The identifiers are destroyed before leaving the health facility. Only \\naggregated data are captured. All data abstraction occurs in a private area, away from \\npatients, and covered (such as closing the folder) if patients are present. \\nf. This activity seeks to determine agreement (and the percentage difference) among \\nreporting tools at the same site, to describe reasons for the discrepancies observed \\nand to make recommendations, if possible, for improvement. \\n \\n2. Physical count using patient charts: in instances where the validity of the indicators produced \\nfrom site-level reporting tools or from cross-validation are of significant concern, the patient files \\ncan be checked and physically counted to confirm the “actual” total of people actively receiving \\nART. Examples of when a physical count might be beneficial include: when source documents \\nused for reporting appear to be significantly incomplete or when there are larger data quality \\nconcerns, such as issues with appropriately accounting for people experiencing interruption in \\ntreatment (IIT) and/or deaths. \\ng.

The number of people actively receiving ART reported may differ from the physical \\nrecount. However, this number should be within acceptable error bounds because of \\nflow in and out of the facility. \\n \\n3. Interruption in treatment (IIT) assessment: in facilities that utilize electronic systems for patient \\nmonitoring and tracking, queries on recent interruptions in treatment can generate a list of \\npatients meeting the IIT criteria. Verification of IIT status in the patient chart can provide an \\nadditional opportunity for validating the accuracy of the electronic system. \\nl. The assessment team works with site staff to query the electronic system to generate a \\nlist of people that have been marked as IIT based on standard definitions. \\nm.

Data management: The data collected and analyzed as part of this assessment will be shared by all \\npartners and the Ministry of Health. These data may be collected using a combination of paper and \\nelectronic forms. Data that are collected on paper forms will be kept in the possession of the field team \\nleads throughout the field exercise. Upon completion of fieldwork, team leads will be responsible for \\ndestroying all personal identifying data forms and transporting all aggregated data back to the main \\noffice. All aggregated data will be entered into an electronic format such as Microsoft Access, Excel or \\nsimilar software. The database used will be password protected and will be available on computers \\nthat are only accessible to the project team.  \\n \\nThe data taken from the site will not include any patient identifiers.

The data collected on paper forms may be kept for up to five years and then destroyed. \\n \\nII. Correction factor to apply to the national numbers of people receiving ART: A key output from \\nthe DQA is a quantitative understanding of the likely level of under- or overreporting of the number of \\npeople receiving treatment nationally during the assessment period. Misreporting of this number can \\narise from the following. \\n \\nIncorrect reporting from the facility and aggregation at the national level. Aggregation of facility level \\nreports to count the number of people receiving treatment at any given time can be subject to error if \\nfacility reports are delayed or missing and not adjusted for or if reports for the facility are entered in \\nduplicate. This type of error can result in either over- or undercounting the actual number of people \\nreceiving treatment. The numbers of people receiving treatment should be corrected to account for \\nmissing facility reports or reports that have been mistakenly entered in duplicate. The desk review in \\nstep 4 assesses this. \\n \\nIncorrect counting of people receiving treatment at the facility level. In addition to simple errors in \\naggregation of data between patient records and reporting forms, incorrect counts of the number of \\npeople receiving treatment may arise from a failure to properly define “currently receiving ART”, from \\nfailure to remove people who have died or disengaged from care or who have transferred facilities or \\nfrom incomplete or backlogged patient records, registers, charts or files. Errors of this type can result \\nin either over- or undercounting the actual number of people receiving treatment at a facility. The \\ncorrect number can be determined by recreating the reported number using patient records and \\nregistries (see subsection 3.3, Step 3: site-level assessment for details). \\n \\nPeople who simultaneously seek care at more than one facility. The number of people receiving \\ntreatment can be incorrectly counted if people are simultaneously registered at and considered to be \\nreceiving treatment by two facilities.  \\n \\nThis error will always result in over-counting the number of people receiving treatment. The correct \\nnumber can be determined by comparing electronic records, where available, across facilities, \\nreviewing possible matches to determine whether they are the same person and then assigning a \\nsingle location for counting purposes. When this comparison can be done with only a subset of the \\npeople receiving treatment, a correction factor could be calculated and applied in addition to the \\ncorrection factor from step i below, if there is agreement that the same level of duplication is occurring \\nin facilities not included in the comparison. If insufficient information is available to determine the \\nunique identity of individuals, this correction factor should not be used.'),\n",

The adjusted ART data also need to be corrected in the national (or subnational) Spectrum \\nestimates file. This will require correcting the historical years as well as the current year.

Central \\nSupport (CS) data has been identified as a data classification, that does not overlap with TA or DSD, which \\ncould fill these gaps and would add to our understanding of an OU's epidemic – highlighting successes and \\nareas needing support. CS data collection is done in conjunction with DSD/TA data collection, to help provide \\nadditional context to services being provided, and the status of the epidemic. In addition to a broader \\nunderstanding of an epidemic, collection of CS data provides insight into services and funding provided \\noutside of the DSD/TA service definitions through support of Host Country governments.  \\n \\nDefinition of Central Support: Centrally supported sites are sites located in areas where PEPFAR is solely \\nproviding financial support at the national, regional or district level,\\u202fwith\\u202fsite-level support through annual visits. \\nThe purpose of this collection activity is to understand further, how close countries are to Epidemic Control, or \\nhow they are maintaining Epidemic Control, with the inclusion of Central Support (CS) data. This chart \\nprovides an example of how the inclusion of CS data can provide a different view of the epidemic at the OU \\nlevel.  \\n \\nAs evidenced in the chart above, Inclusion of CS results allows us to see that this OU is closer to the 95-95-95 \\ngoals than previously evidenced with only DSD/TA data.  \\n \\n \\nData Type vs. Prioritization  \\n• Central Support Data Type: The CS data type, in comparison to the DSD and TA data types, should be \\nreported from sites where PEPFAR is solely providing financial support at the national, regional or \\ndistrict level, and site support is through annual visits. Collection of this data allows for insight into \\nprograms not directly supported (but financially supported) by PEFPAR.  \\n• Central Support Prioritization: Prioritization levels are determined for SNUs during COP planning, based \\non where an SNU sits in reaching 95/95/95 goals. CS prioritization is given when site specific activities \\nhave transitioned to government or other support.7   \\no CS Prioritization does not mean all data should be collected under the CS data classification. \\nSNUs with a CS prioritization currently collect data under DSD, TA, and CS data types. \\no Please review the most recent COP Guidance for further information on the Central Support \\nprioritization.  \\n \\nCentral Support Reporting Requirements  \\n• Indicators: Centrally Supported site-level data should be reported for each of the six required indicators for \\ncentrally supported data: HTS_TST, TX_NEW, TX_CURR, TX_PVLS, PMTCT_STAT, PMTCT_ART \\n• Disaggregates: CS results should be disaggregated at the most complete, and specific level possible. \\nComplete reporting on the age/sex disaggregates that sum to the total numerator is necessary for \\n \\n7 COP/ROP 21 Guidance for All Countries\"),\n",

If reporting on additional disaggregates is not \\nfeasible, please contact SGAC_SI at SGAC_SI@state.gov and copy your PEPFAR Program Manager. \\n• Frequency: CS Indicators should be reported on at least an annual basis. CS Indicators are available for \\nquarterly reporting for OUs with available data. If available, CS indicators should be reported on a \\nquarterly basis. If reporting annually, CS indicators should be summed (except for TX_CURR) so that Q4 \\ndata is equal to the annual cumulative.  \\n• Implementing Mechanisms (IM): \\no Data will not be deduplicated across CS, DSD/TA. Ensure that you are only submitting applicable \\ndata under CS or DSD/TA.   \\no The same IM can be used for DSD/TA data reporting, with the appropriate CS/DSD/TA tab being \\nutilized in the DATIM entry screens.  \\no IMs used for central support are determined on country-by-country basis, and these decisions \\nshould have been made during COP discussions. \\n• Data Entry in DATIM: \\no Required indicators for CS reporting will reflect an option for “CS” reporting where OUs can report \\nsite-level results for centrally supported sites. A snapshot of the tab from the DATIM data entry \\nscreen is provided below. \\n \\n \\n \\nDetails on central support reporting – including the designation of centrally supported SNUs, \\nreporting frequency, and reporting mechanisms - should be decided during COP discussions.

As recommended in the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), Principles \\nand Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System for every death, civil registration systems should collect \\ninformation such as date and cause of death (COD), age, sex and place of residence. \\n \\nAny time activities to reach and reengage patients on treatment are conducted and it is concluded that an ART \\npatient has died, the death should be reported into the formal civil registration system if it is established that \\nthis has not already been done. Where it has been done, in settings where death registration systems are \\nactive, it may be possible to link existing civil registration records of death and COD with ART patient records \\nto ascertain those who have experienced an interruption in treatment (IIT). \\n \\nPEPFAR teams should work collaboratively with their Ministries of Health in conjunction with civil registration \\nauthorities (often located within Ministries of Interior or Home Affairs) to enhance civil registration and vital \\nstatistics systems and to establish consistent procedures for collecting and linking mortality data (i.e., to \\nensure the same data elements are collected for matching purposes). WHO guidance is available to help \\ncountries establish or strengthen civil registration systems. CDC has a team dedicated to strengthening CRVS \\nsystems internationally, within the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is available to provide \\ntechnical assistance.  \\n \\nDeaths among ART patients that occur in the health facility: Deaths occurring within the health facility should \\nbe immediately recorded in the ART register and/other relevant tracking register, which may or may not \\nalready include cause of death. The Medical Certificate of Death and Cause of Death (MCCD) should be filled \\nto ascertain COD and is also a data source for obtaining mortality-related data for patients who died in the \\nfacility. If filled according to WHO/ICD guidelines, and coded correctly, the underlying cause of death (UCOD) \\nwill be identified. When filled correctly, the MCCD will also include a sequence of events leading to the \\nimmediate cause of death. It will also list conditions that are not in the causal chain but are related to the \\ncause of death. If these are entered electronically (through the WHO DHIS mortality module or alternative \\nelectronic system), these fields (Part I, a-d, and Part II) can all be coded and/or searched.  \\n \\nMCCD forms are typically embedded in national death reporting forms, which include demographic information \\nand other country-specific requirements for registration. Completed death reporting forms should be sent to \\nthe national registration authorities for legal registration. Even without COD, recording and reporting all deaths \\namong HIV-infected patients, and the general population, as well as knowing mortality rates, etc., is valuable. \\n \\nDeaths among ART patients that occur outside the health facility: Deaths that occur outside the facility should \\nbe confirmed by unambiguous report of family or close acquaintance (i.e., it should not be presumed). COD in \\ncommunity settings is commonly ascertained through verbal autopsy. Verbal autopsy is a method of gathering \\nhealth-information about a patient that has died in order to determine their probable COD; it typically includes \\nan interview with a caregiver to elicit known diagnoses, signs, and symptoms experienced by the deceased as \\nwell as an open narrative describing the circumstances of the death. Where a system for verbal autopsy is in \\nplace, PEPFAR teams should coordinate with local authorities to identify the best COD information available \\n(e.g., reported conditions, open narrative, probable COD assigned).  Where such a system is not in place, \\nverbal autopsy could be introduced or, for purposes of this indicator, unvalidated family reporting can be \\naccepted to determine cause of death. For more information on verbal autopsy, see the WHO verbal autopsy \\nstandards.  \\n \\nCaveats: \\nIt is widely acknowledged that even where reporting is required, mortality data, especially cause of death, are \\noften underreported or inaccurate. Where high quality MCCD is available, PEPFAR teams can expect to find \\nUCOD according to the standard definitions provided. However, where systems are weak, teams may need to \\nuse whatever COD information is available for reference to best describe conditions co-existing at the time of \\ndeath. For verbal autopsy, it should also be noted that since verbal autopsy results are generally considered \\nvalid only at the population level, teams are likely to be able to elicit information about conditions coexisting at \\nthe time of death rather than a specific UCOD. For reference, the National Center for Health Statistics at CDC'),\n",

PEPFAR is partnering with the international community to accelerate \\ntowards the UNAIDS 95-95-95 global goals: 95 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status, 95 \\npercent of people who know their HIV status are accessing treatment, and 95 percent of people on treatment \\nhave suppressed viral loads. Progress towards epidemic control will be successfully measured, in part, through \\nan effective strategic information framework that not only monitors program outputs, but also key outcomes and \\nprogrammatic impact.  \\n \\nUNAIDS data shows that many PEPFAR countries have successfully reduced HIV incidence and are at or near \\nepidemic control. (Refer to the latest COP Guidance for information on progress towards epidemic control by \\ncountry.) As countries reach and maintain epidemic control, the program monitoring approach will shift to focus \\non case surveillance and examining viral load suppression gaps to improve programmatic implementation for \\nspecific populations not yet at 95-95-95.  \\n \\nFigure 1: PEPFAR Monitoring: Getting from Process to Impact \\n \\n \\n \\nGiven the global HIV progress over the past decade, planning, monitoring, and resource allocation must occur at \\nthe subnational, community, and site levels in order to achieve the greatest impact. Collection and use of \\ndisaggregated data that characterizes the populations (e.g., age, sex, key or priority populations, etc.) served in \\nthe lowest geographic areas where HIV services are being provided is critical in understanding current program \\nperformance and planning for future performance. Overlaying that data with the partners that are supporting the \\nimplementation of HIV services can also help us to understand the fidelity with which programmatic interventions \\nare being taken to scale within those specific populations and geographic regions. \\n \\nThe objectives of the MER guidance document are to streamline and prioritize indicators for PEPFAR programs; \\nhowever, MER indicators are not an exhaustive list of all metrics that should be monitored by PEPFAR \\nprograms and host country government. PEPFAR programs should continually monitor and assess any acute \\nprogrammatic issues and collect additional data to inform program improvement.  \\n \\nPEPFAR reviews MER indicators on an annual basis to ensure: \\n• indicators align with the programs planned for implementation and the expectations for both program \\nmonitoring and partner management practices;  \\n• indicators reflect any new PEPFAR initiatives and/or emerging programmatic areas; \\n• indicators align with multilaterals and partner governments to avoid duplication of data collection, where \\npossible;  \\n• continuous alignment within PEPFAR data streams (e.g., SIMS, expenditure reporting, SID etc.).; \\n• that redundancies are reduced between indicators; and \\n• that the MER guidance and training materials reinforce the relationships within and between indicators;  \\n \\nGranular aggregate data has been a powerful tool to monitor and manage the progress of programs in reaching \\nepidemic control. As countries continue to reach and maintain epidemic control, there is a need for individual \\nlevel data systems to address the remaining gaps among specific populations (e.g. 15-25 year-olds, key \\npopulations). Discussions with PEPFAR staff and external stakeholders, as well as feedback submitted through \\nthe MER Refresh survey, highlight a need for information based off of electronic individual-level data systems. \\nIndividual-level data can track clients across the clinical cascade and is nimble to evolving programmatic\"),\n",

Country programs and governments should continue to work to develop individual-level EMR, \\nlaboratory, surveillance, and other data systems that can monitor patient outcomes in conjunction with other \\ndisease areas, especially as the HIV cohort continues to age. The following indicator requests submitted through \\nthe MER Refresh survey are examples of critical information needs that could be answered using individual level \\ndata. This information will not be collected through MER this year, but countries should prepare to report on it in \\nthe future by utilizing individual level data systems: \\n \\n• Number of TB clients with a recent negative HIV status \\n• Number of clients with a reactive self-test that received a confirmatory test, as well as test result \\n• Number of ART clients on specific TPT regimens, including 1HP and 3HP \\n• ARV clients receiving multi-month dispensation by fine age \\n• Viral load coverage and suppression among pregnant and breastfeeding women by age \\n \\nStrong surveillance systems are a critical component of a sustainable health systems infrastructure. This has \\nbeen further illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Health infrastructure, laboratory systems, and surveillance \\nsystems developed for HIV have been utilized in the COVID-19 response, with HIV and COVID-19 data \\nreviewed together. Additionally, individual-level data systems will be integral in determining gaps across the \\nclinical cascade that developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. With countries at or nearing epidemic control, it \\nis important that COVID-19 does not deter patient outcomes and the health of people living with HIV. Therefore, \\ndrilling down to the individual and tailoring programs to specific populations will be necessary to continue to \\nclose these final gaps.'),\n",

Per the 2017 WHO \\nConsolidated Guidelines on Person-Centered HIV Patient Monitoring and Case Surveillance, person-centered \\nmonitoring refers to a shift from monitoring measuring services (e.g., the number of HIV tests or people on \\ntreatment) to monitoring people at the center of their \\naccess to linked HIV and health services. In \\nessence, this marks a shift to better support the \\nclients accessing services by focusing more on their \\nindividual health outcomes. \\nPEPFAR’s commitment to person-centered \\nmonitoring is evidenced throughout this guidance \\ndocument through: \\n• Indicators (i.e., HTS_RECENT) that allow \\nprograms to better understand clusters of \\nrecently-infected patients and spur \\nprogrammatic action in order to intervene to stop \\nactive infections (i.e., through interventions such \\nas index testing services and test & start). \\n• Outcome-focused cascade analyses (e.g., index \\ntesting, prevention). \\n• Further modernizations to treatment indicators to \\ncontinue to understand ART patient outcomes \\nand continuity of treatment in the era of \\ndifferentiated care (i.e., TX_ML, TX_RTT). \\n• A continued commitment to ensure data \\ndisaggregation by standard five-year age bands \\nin order to further enhance programmatic focus on strengthening patient-level monitoring systems. \\n• Ensuring COP-funding for health information systems projects is impactful and supports: (1) interoperability \\nbetween systems; (2) the adoption of standardized disaggregations; (3) shifts away from paper-based to \\nelectronic reporting; and (4) the adoption or expansion of HIV surveillance systems for public health \\nresponse. \\nPerson-centered monitoring and care is best practice in serving both the needs of the patient and the goals of \\nreaching epidemic control program more broadly. To reach epidemic control, all people living with HIV (PLHIV) \\nmust be identified, linked immediately to treatment, and have continuity of treatment to achieve viral \\nsuppression. If PLHIV do not have continuity of treatment, they are at risk of continued transmission and costly \\ninterventions are needed to track them.  \\nBoth the PEPFAR MER Guidance and the 2020 WHO Consolidated HIV Strategic Information Guidelines \\nunderscore the importance of tracing patients whose treatment has been interrupted. PEPFAR defines \\ninterruption in treatment (IIT) as no clinical contact for 28 days after the last scheduled appointment or expected \\nclinical contact. This is equivalent to the WHO concept of loss to follow up (LTFU). The use of the 28-day \\nstandard for IIT and LTFU is critical to promote timely identification of patient outcomes among patients known \\nto have missed clinical visits or drug pickups. Clients should be traced in an active, safe, and confidential way \\nthat assures sustained adherence to treatment moving forward. Health care workers should leverage best \\npractices to reach clients experiencing IIT, while protecting confidentiality. Interruptions in antiretroviral treatment \\ncan cause viral load to rebound in as little as one to two weeks in HIV+ patients that were previously suppressed \\non ART therapy. The longer a patient remains off treatment, the greater the likelihood that their viral load will \\nrebound to a point of no longer being undetectable. \\nBecause undetectable viral load means that patients cannot transmit HIV (U=U), it is important to get patients \\nback on treatment not only for their own health, but for the health of others in the community. Expeditious action \\nin defaulter tracing to bring clients back to treatment well before their viral load has the opportunity to rebound is \\na key example of how patient centered monitoring ensures the best outcome for both the patient and towards \\nour shared goal of epidemic control. However, some countries are struggling to maintain gains towards epidemic \\nFigure 2: Patient-Centered Monitoring in PEPFAR'),\n",

This means that roughly \\n51,784 patients from the total treatment cohort did not remain on treatment due to continuity of treatment issues, \\ndata quality issues, etc. By examining TX_ML, we can see that the majority of known losses are due to clients \\nwho were on treatment for more than 3 months prior to experiencing an interruption in treatment.  \\nFigure 3b shows a detailed breakdown of TX_ML for the same program. The data show that the SNU on the far \\nright is experiencing the most program loss, while most interruptions in treatment are among females in the 20-\\n34 age range who have been on treatment for 3+ months.  \\nFigure 3a: Potential treatment client loss in one PEPFAR program in FY21 Q2 \\n \\nSource: PEFPAR Panorama, Single OU Dossier, “Waterfall analysis – TX_NET_NEW” \\nFigure 3b: Detailed breakdown of TX_ML data \\n \\nSource: PEPFAR Panorama, Treatment Single OU Dossier, “Program Loss”'),\n",

Refer to the PEPFAR Data Calendar for key deadlines and data cleaning dates. \\n \\nPEPFAR MER indicators vary in periodicity of reporting. Different indicators reflect different time periods for \\nservices being provided. Quarterly indicators are those indicators focused primarily on the clinical cascade: HIV \\ncase finding, diagnosis, linkage, treatment, continuity of treatment, and viral load suppression. Semi-annual \\nindicators are those focused primarily on HIV prevention and supply chain monitoring. Annual indicators are \\nthose focused primarily on health systems and host country reporting. \\n \\nFigure 4: Indicator reporting frequency and the PEPFAR fiscal year \\n \\n \\n \\nBased on programmatic gaps in case finding, linkages, index testing scale-up, and continuity of treatment some \\nindicators such as HTS_TST, HTS_TST_POS, HTS_RECENT, HTS_INDEX, TX_ML, TX_RTT, TX_NEW, and \\nlinkages should be monitored by PEPFAR programs more frequently (e.g., weekly) than what is required in the \\nMER. Moving to real-time (or near real-time) monitoring of key indicators helps to ensure that rapid actions are \\ntaken to course correct areas of underperformance well before the next POART. \\n \\nPlease contact SGAC_SI@state.gov with any additional questions about the MER-related reporting \\nrequirements. \\nDISAGGREGATED MONITORING  \\nDisaggregation of data is key to understanding if PEPFAR-supported services are reaching the intended \\nbeneficiaries and locations. Triangulation of routine program data with underlying geographic, demographic, and \\nepidemiologic data is fundamental to PEPFAR planning, monitoring, and reporting processes. To ensure that no \\none in need of services is being left behind, PEPFAR requires the routine disaggregation of data by the following \\ncategories, where applicable: \\nLocation: PEPFAR clinical indicators are disaggregated to the facility-level. Where services are provided in the \\ncommunity, data are reported at an intermediate community-level (e.g., ward, sub-district, or district). PEPFAR \\nanalyses for planning and support focus on the subnational level (e.g., district).  \\nAge: In order to advance the standardization of patient monitoring and routine health information systems, \\nPEPFAR requires standardized reporting by five-year age bands. PEPFAR programs are required to report on \\nthe following standard age groups: <1, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, and \\n50+. Starting in FY22, the age bands for TX_CURR will be expanded to 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, and 65+. It is \\nrecommended that country teams review data on life expectancy and new infections and prepare to extend in-\\ncountry and/or national reporting systems beyond the 50+ age band threshold as appropriate.'),\n",

Both clinical and key population-specific partners should complete \\nthese disaggregations, but only if it is safe to maintain these files and report. The first priority of data \\ncollection and reporting of program data for key populations must be to DO NO HARM! These data \\nmust be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are protected and to prevent further stigma \\nand discrimination of key populations. \\nThe key populations disaggregations for clinical indicators are as follows: people who inject drugs, men who \\nhave sex with men, transgender people, female sex workers, and people in prison and other closed settings.  \\nKey populations disaggregations are included for the following indicators: KP_PREV, HTS_TST, HTS_RECENT, \\nHTS_SELF, PrEP_NEW, PrEP_CT, TX_NEW, TX_CURR, TX_ML, TX_RTT, and TX_PVLS. However, it is \\nimportant to note that an individual’s inclusion in some key populations is subject to change over time (e.g., an \\nindividual may engage in sex work or inject drugs for specific periods in their life) and should be assessed at \\neach clinical encounter to ensure accurate reporting of these disaggregations on indicators such as TX_CURR. \\nThe PEPFAR key populations reporting guidance is designed to avoid double-counting and ensure that the KP \\ndata reported can be meaningfully interpreted. Despite persons potentially falling into more than one KP \\ndisaggregate (e.g., an FSW who injects drugs, MSM that is currently incarcerated), implementing partners \\nshould be instructed to report an individual in only one KP category with which s/he is most identified. This \\nguidance applies to all key populations-associated indicators. Refer to the key populations classification \\ndocument found in Appendix A for additional information on how to assess the needs of key populations client. \\nPriority Populations: PP_PREV includes a series of optional priority population types for reporting. Please note \\nthat although reporting of the priority populations disaggregation is optional – it is highly recommended. \\nTypes of PEPFAR Support: To understand the level of support and the type of investments being provided, \\ndata are disaggregated by either direct service delivery (DSD) or technical assistance for service delivery \\nimprovement (TA-SDI). More information on these categories is provided in the section below. \\nDISAGGREGATION TYPES: \\nThere are three categories of MER indicator disaggregations, which can be seen in the indicator reference \\nsheets and the DATIM data entry screens.  \\nRequired Disaggregations: Required indicates that this indicator disaggregate is required for all countries that \\nhave programming for this area. This means that if the country supports a program area, defined by budget and \\ntargets set during the COP process, then it is required to report results.  \\nConditional Disaggregations: Conditional disaggregates include those for which some additional condition \\nmust be fulfilled. There are two main types of conditional indicator disaggregations: \\na. Disaggregations for those programs that have received initiative-specific funds for special programming \\nsuch as DREAMS. There is also one full indicator, AGYW_PREV, that is conditional and based on \\nDREAMS funding. \\nb. Disaggregations for which field teams have received permission or a waiver from their PEPFAR \\nProgram Manager to report on, such as reporting on the coarse age disaggregations instead of the finer \\nage disaggregations. In this case reporting is considered conditional based on written approval from \\nOGAC.  \\nOptional Disaggregations: Optional disaggregates should be completed by those for which the indicator is \\nuseful to determine the success of their program (e.g., priority population disaggregations in PP_PREV).  \\nPEPFAR SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES AND SITES \\nCompleting the fourth full year of quarterly site-level monitoring by all PEPFAR implementing agencies and \\npartners has provided granular data that demonstrate important differences in patient outcomes and site \\nperformance. These results should be used to prioritize resources, staff, and interventions among sites to \\ndetermine the appropriate extent of support and monitoring needed based on site-level outputs and quality \\noutcomes.'),\n",

In areas where PEPFAR is supporting attained, scale-up, and sustained services the type of \\nsupport should be categorized as Direct Service Delivery (DSD) or Technical Assistance-Service Delivery \\nImprovement (TA-SDI).  \\nIn areas where PEPFAR is not providing support at the site level but is providing financial support at the national \\nor subnational levels, then this support should be characterized as Central Support (CS). DSD and TA-SDI \\ninclude all sites receiving one or more PEPFAR-supported visits during the year. Importantly, site-level quarterly \\nresults and SIMS data should be analyzed and used to determine the number of program support visits needed \\neach year to optimize the quality of HIV/AIDS services and impact. PEPFAR teams should work with \\nimplementing partners to ensure that programmatic data (including MER and SIMS results) are being used in \\nthis way. The key is to ensure that PEPFAR-supported sites receive the appropriate number of technical \\nassistance visits based on their performance. Refer to the “PEPFAR-support definition” section within each \\nindicator reference sheet for indicator-specific DSD and TA-SDI descriptions. \\nDSD: Individuals will be counted as receiving direct service delivery support from PEPFAR when BOTH of the \\nconditions below are met: Provision of key staff or commodities AND support to improve the quality of \\nservices through site visits as often as deemed necessary by the partner and country team.  \\nTA-SDI: Individuals will be counted as supported through TA-SDI when the point of service delivery receives \\nsupport from PEPFAR that meets the second criterion ONLY: support to improve the quality of services \\nthrough site visits as often as deemed necessary by the partner and country team. \\n1. PEPFAR is directly interacting with the patient or beneficiary in response to their health (physical, \\npsychological, etc.) care needs by providing key staff and/or essential commodities for routine service \\ndelivery. Staff who are responsible for the completeness and quality of routine patient records (paper or \\nelectronic) can be counted here; however, staff who exclusively fulfill MOH and donor reporting \\nrequirements cannot be counted. Each indicator reference sheet includes a list of key staff and/or \\nessential commodities that meet this condition. \\nAND/OR \\n2. PEPFAR provides an established presence at and/or routinized support for those services at the point of \\nservice delivery. Each indicator reference sheet includes a list of activities that count toward support for \\nservice delivery improvement. \\nSUPPORT IN CENTRALLY SUPPORTED AREAS: In areas where PEPFAR is solely providing \\nfinancial support at the national, regional or district level, site level support will be through annual visits. \\nHowever, to support the host country government with quality monitoring, it is recommended that results \\nreported through national health information systems should be jointly monitored with the government on a \\nquarterly basis. SIMS visits may also be conducted at these sites if quality issues are identified.  \\nDue to the financial investments PEPFAR provides at the above-service delivery area in centrally supported \\nsites and SNUs, it is important that results be provided to ensure that quality assurance initiatives are having the \\nintended impact. PEPFAR programs should be focused on supporting the national program in their respective \\ncountry to achieve 90% ART coverage (i.e., 95-95-95) for PLHIV; therefore, it is extremely important to \\nunderstand the services provided to PLHIV across the entire country. \\nWhile patient and beneficiary-support activities have transitioned to government or other support, PEPFAR \\ncontinues to provide support for overarching activities, such as quality assurance and quality improvement \\n(QA/QI) to ensure that patients continue to receive quality services. As such, PEPFAR will continue monitoring \\nactivities in centrally supported sites annually via the following indicators: HTS_TST, TX_CURR, TX_NEW, \\nTX_PVLS, PMTCT_STAT, and PMTCT_ART.  \\nResults in centrally supported areas should be reported once annually at Q4 each year. Site-level data in \\ncentrally-supported areas should be reported on the Central Support (CS) tab of the DATIM data entry screen \\nfor each of the six indicators required for centrally supported reporting: HTS_TST, TX_CURR, TX_NEW, \\nTX_PVLS, PMTCT_STAT, and PMTCT_ART. For additional information, please refer to Appendix G: Central \\nSupport.'),\n",

Monitoring the host country HIV response is critical to understanding both the achievements and the \\ngaps at the subnational level and within specific populations. Host country data are used to inform PEPFAR \\nprograms and guide how PEPFAR resources are allocated. The key program areas for monitoring host country \\ntargets and results are: prevention of mother to child transmission programs, key populations, voluntary male \\nmedical circumcision and HIV diagnosis and treatment, including viral suppression.  \\nHost country data are needed from both the national and subnational level. The subnational level is considered \\nthe organizational level in which the country team has prioritized their program (PSNU). Data on the host \\ncountry national program is reported to PEPFAR for all subnational units, regardless of PEPFAR funding \\nsupporting these geographical areas; so that the total of the subnational results or targets should equal the total \\nnumber of national results and targets. \\nIncreasingly, individual-level surveillance data are critical to implement and used in conjunction with the MOH to \\ncapture data from recent infections to deaths. \\nAt the host country national level, to sufficiently monitor its national response, the host country government’s \\nnational set of indicators should include the minimum set of harmonized global indicators (UNAIDS Global AIDS \\nMonitoring) and additional indicators that represent the needs of the country’s program. The PEPFAR Country \\nteam should collaborate with the host country government and other stakeholders to make sure that PEPFAR \\nreporting requirements are taken into consideration in the host country’s national set. In constructing its own \\ncomprehensive set of requirements for monitoring the USG response in support of the host country national \\nprogram, each PEPFAR country team will review all of the PEPFAR essential host country national indicators for \\napplicability to the PEPFAR activities being conducted in the host country.  \\nPEPFAR host country national and subnational level indicators represent results obtained within the entire host \\ncountry regardless of PEPFAR support. All PEPFAR countries should report host country results at Q4 each \\nfiscal year.  \\nHost country results are also reported at the site-level for a subset of indicators. The majority of these facility-\\nlevel indicators will be reported through the PEPFAR-MOH data alignment process. In FY21, all PEPFAR \\noperating units are expected to report through the PEPFAR-MOH data alignment on an annual basis for the \\nfollowing indicators: HTS_TST, TX_CURR, TX_NEW, PMTCT_STAT, PMTCT_ART, and TB_PREV. \\nHOST COUNTRY TARGETS \\nTargets for the host country national and subnational indicators should be reported into DATIM during COP. \\nDeveloping targets for the next year at the national and subnational levels is an important step in understanding \\nthe national program and determining geographic investments (including host country, The Global Fund and \\nother donors). When PEPFAR better understands the target setting process of the national program, then it is \\nbetter placed to support the program and to fill necessary impactful programmatic gaps. Please describe the \\ntarget setting process that the host country employs in the narratives and partnering donors. The national \\ntargets should cover the next calendar or fiscal year; the timeframe should be indicated in the narratives.  \\nHOST COUNTRY RESULTS \\nAt Q4 of the USG fiscal year, results from the host country systems should be reported up until the most recent \\nmonth of collection and include 12 months of data. These may not align with the USG fiscal year end results. \\nThese data should be collected continuously at the subnational level. Data should be in line with GARPR and \\nUNAIDS reported data, where available, although they may differ due to different reporting periods. In the \\nnarratives, please indicate what months the data include (e.g., October 2018-September 2019; or July 2018 to \\nJune 2019). Results should be consistently reported on the same time period to be able to monitor trends over \\ntime.'),\n",

Also take note that narratives for both National (_NAT) and Subnational (_SUBNAT) should be \\nrecorded in the _NAT narrative section in DATIM. \\nJustification Narrative \\n• How does the national number relate to the PEPFAR number? \\n• What proportion of results does PEPFAR contribute to the national response? \\n• If the PEPFAR result is larger than the national number, this should be described in detail. \\n• Note the actual reporting time frame for entered data. \\nSource Narrative \\n• What is the source of these data? \\n• When were these data collected/calculated? \\nINITIATIVE-SPECIFIC NARRATIVES \\nInitiative-specific narratives provide an opportunity to better understand key investments and interventions as \\nthey relate to PEPFAR’s special initiatives (e.g., DREAMS, Faith and Community Initiative, etc.). These \\nnarratives are collected in DATIM and country teams should respond to the initiative-specific prompts and \\nguidance listed in the “Monitoring Special Initiatives” chapter.   \\nCALCULATED INDICATORS \\nA calculated indicator is a MER indicator that is generated using values that were entered manually via DATIM. \\nCalculated indicators facilitate analysis of MER data and reduce the chance for error introduced by manual \\ncalculations. Three types of calculated indicators are shown below. Please refer to Appendix B for a detailed list \\nof calculated indicators and their corresponding calculations. \\n \\nType 1: Sum of disaggregates to Total Numerator \\nThe “Total Numerator” value for each indicator is calculated from the sum of specific disaggregates within the \\nindicator. This prevents discrepancies resulting from entering the total numerator and disaggregates separately.  \\n \\nExample: \\nTB_STAT Total Numerator =  \\nTB_STAT Known Positives by age/sex \\n+ TB_STAT Newly Tested Positives by age/sex \\n+ TB_STAT New Negatives by age/sex \\n \\nType 2: Sum of disaggregates to new disaggregate \\nOften, there are specific groups of disaggregates that are reviewed on a routine basis. Rather than summing the \\ndisaggregates during each analysis, a calculated disaggregate is generated to facilitate the review. In this \\nexample, TB_STAT_POS is calculated to generate the total number of HIV-positive individuals documented as \\npart of TB_STAT.  \\n \\nExample: \\nTB_STAT_POS =  \\nTB_STAT Known Positives by age/sex  \\n                      + TB_STAT Newly Tested Positives by age/sex  \\n      \\nType 3: Copying of data to new indicator \\nIn many cases, data that is collected as part of one indicator is useful for analysis in another indicator. Rather \\nthan require that the same data be entered in multiple places, the data can be entered once and copied to other \\nsystem-generated indicators. In this example, the number of HIV-positive TB cases is collected as part of \\nTB_STAT, and used as the denominator for TB_ART. TB_ART (D) is not entered directly – it is generated \\nautomatically using values that were originally entered under TB_STAT.'),\n",

Measuring the success of PEPFAR’s initiatives requires \\nstrong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems that can routinely produce high quality data. Efforts to ensure \\ndata quality, therefore, are not singular events occurring randomly. Rather, these processes need to become \\ninstitutionalized as part of the entire data management cycle. Once achieved, data quality helps to ensure that \\nlimited resources are used effectively, progress toward established goals is accurately monitored, measured and \\nreported, and decisions are based on strong evidence.  \\n \\nOver the past five years, efforts to ensure a data-driven approach to decision making has allowed global HIV \\nprograms to dramatically expand their results and impact in a budget-neutral environment. The combination of \\nstrengthened monitoring indicators, information regarding site and service delivery quality, site-specific program \\nresults, and a more detailed understanding of the geographic distribution of the burden of disease has allowed \\nHIV programs to identify exactly where the HIV epidemic is occurring and where programs can maximize their \\nimpact in response. \\n \\nData quality has always been a focus of global HIV monitoring and reporting efforts. Specifically, all countries \\nconducting programming supported by PEPFAR are expected to have a data quality strategy in place. For \\nexample, data quality assessments (DQAs) should be routinely conducted and action should be taken because \\nof these DQAs. If errors are identified in data, these should be remediated at the point of service delivery as well \\nas in the PEPFAR and host-country reporting systems as soon as possible.  \\n \\nMore specifically, as many countries are approaching the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals, it is more important than \\never to understand exactly how many people living with HIV are receiving treatment. Furthermore, it is \\nimperative that countries understand the treatment gaps remaining by location and population to ensure that all \\nPLHIV have equitable access to treatment and are virally suppressed and that scarce resources are allocated \\nappropriately to areas with the greatest unmet need. As such, we are at a very important moment in the HIV \\nresponse where accuracy of the data is essential in ensuring that programmatic decisions are made effectively. \\nPEPFAR is committed to ensuring that the data collected through the MER is accurate and timely. It is \\nessential to not only capture high-quality data, but to also continuously use and analyze the data to \\nachieve maximum program impact. The only way to improve the data is to use the data. \\n \\nUnderstanding the treatment gaps by location and populations means conducting DQAs by age and sex to \\ncorrect discrepancies by population that exist in the TX_CURR numbers. Significant shifts in age and sex \\ncoverage levels can be observed when TX_CURR numbers are reset based on DQAs.  \\nFor more information on data quality, please refer to “Data Quality Assessment of National and Partner HIV \\nTreatment and Patient Monitoring Systems.” The approved DQA protocol from this guidance can also be found \\nin Appendix C.'),\n",

With greater emphasis on patient-centered monitoring comes a need to \\nunderstand patient-level data beyond the aggregate indicators.  \\nHIV programmatic aggregate data are not fully de-duplicated (though within antiretroviral treatment programs \\nmany are) and do not provide data on the number of people living with HIV or accurate data for total persons \\ndiagnosed. Periodic surveys offer individual de-duplicated data, denominators, and the 95-95-95 cascade, but \\nare cross-sectional (one point in time) and are expensive to conduct. \\nStandardized health data surveillance systems offer countries a mechanism to complement aggregate reporting \\nsystems and surveys with quality HIV data that emphasizes individual de-duplicated data to more accurately \\nreport the 95-95-95 cascade. \\nThese surveillance systems, when comprehensive, emphasize case finding and case reporting of new \\ndiagnoses (including recent infections), identify if the newly diagnosed are linked to treatment, and provide \\ndisaggregation by age, sex, geography, and risk. This in turn can trigger a public health response to effectively \\nintervene and make the necessary adjustments from a surveillance and programmatic perspective to prevent \\nnew cases as countries strive to achieve and sustain epidemic control. There are several paths countries can \\ntake to obtain standardized health data exchanges and surveillance systems that track individual patients with \\nthe removal of duplicates by key HIV sentinel events [first HIV positive diagnoses (by new and chronic infection), \\nfirst CD4 count (after diagnosis), antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation, first viral load test, viral suppression \\n(follow up viral load tests), and death]. We describe two paths: (1) case-based surveillance (CBS) and (2) \\nlinkage of routine program data. Both approaches allow countries to monitor HIV cases longitudinally, providing \\nreal-time estimates of new diagnosis, treatment, and viral suppression by age, sex, and sub-national unit.  \\nMany countries see the need and importance of standardized health data exchanges and surveillance systems \\nbut are not sure where to begin, what is needed, or do not have the requisite system attributes. For example, \\ncountries lack interoperability within their health systems infrastructure for data linkage between services to \\noccur, methods to uniquely identify patients, and the important endpoint of mortality due to inadequate vital \\nregistration systems. \\nCOMMITMENT TO DATA TRANSPARENCY \\nPEPFAR is committed to data transparency. Site (de-identified) and SNU-level results are posted each quarter \\nfor the public to view, download, and analyze through Panorama Spotlight. \\n \\nFor more in-depth analyses, partners and stakeholders external to PEPFAR may request access to data for \\nadditional PEPFAR data elements. For more specific information around data sharing in PEPFAR, please \\nconsult the PEPFAR Data Governance policy.'),\n",

All 15 DREAMS countries will be required to submit a DREAMS \\nLayering Table detailing their primary/secondary/contextual interventions for each age band \\nto S/GAC and their AGYW ISMEs on an annual basis.  \\n• Primary services/interventions are defined as interventions that ALL AGYW in an age \\ngroup should receive if they are enrolled in DREAMS in an OU.  \\n• Secondary services/interventions are needs-based interventions that are part of an \\nOU’s DREAMS core package but may not be received by all AG W in that age group \\n(i.e., only AGYW who experience violence should receive post-violence care).  \\n• Contextual interventions are those that are part of an OU’s DREAMS core package but \\ncannot be linked to an individual AGYW (i.e., community mobilization). Note that these \\ninterventions should be included in your layering table but are not tracked as part of the \\nAGYW_PREV indicator as, by definition, they are not linked to individual AGYW.  \\n \\nOnly services provided by PEPFAR count under AGYW_PREV. However, if PEPFAR \\nimplementing partners are making active referrals to a service provided by a non-PEPFAR \\nentity, the active referral may be counted as a DREAMS service under AG YW_PREV. If this \\nis the case, your OU-specific Layering Table should specify this (e.g., “facilitating access to \\ngovernment education subsidies” instead of just “education subsidies”). \\n \\nCounting Service and Package Completion:  \\nServices/interventions should only be counted towards primary package completion if the \\nAGYW has completed that particular service/intervention. Countries should define \\nservice/intervention completion as part of their country-specific DREAMS Layering \\nTable. Completion definitions should be based on normative guidance and instructions from \\nprogram developers where available (e.g., country may count a multi-session intervention \\nas complete after participant has attended 80% of the sessions if that is what the \\ninstructions from the program developer indicate as completion). Do not count an \\nintervention towards primary/secondary package completion for an individual AGYW until it \\nhas been completed per the country’s service completion definition. Please note that \\n“primary package completion” as tracked in AG W_PRE  and “DREAMS program \\ncompletion” as defined in the DREAMS Guidance are not the same thing. DREAMS \\nprogram completion requires that an individual AGYW has completed both the primary \\npackage for her age group, as well as all secondary interventions that are appropriate \\nbased on her needs. \\n \\nAn AGYW must have completed at least one service in the past 6 months at Q2 or the past \\n12 months at Q4 to be counted in any of the following disaggregates: “completed the full \\nprimary package and no additional services”, “completed the primary package and at least \\none additional service”, or “completed at least one service but not the full primary package.” \\nAt Q2 and Q4 reporting, AGYW should be reported under the disaggregate that reflects the \\nsnapshot of her current layering status since beginning the DREAMS program. Fo r \\nexample, if an AGYW completed her last service in the primary package in the last 6 \\nmonths (at Q2) or 12 months (at Q4) then she may be counted in the corresponding \\nnumerator disaggregate for the current time period, even if she enrolled and began \\nreceiving services in DREAMS beginning in a previous year or reporting period. For AGYW \\nreported in the disaggregate of “completed at least one service but not the fully primary \\npackage”, any DREAMS service (from the primary or secondary package) may be counted.  \\n \\nAn AGYW that is enrolled and has started a DREAMS service but has not yet completed it \\nas of the end of the reporting period is still considered an active DREAMS participant (see \\nabove). She would be reported in the corresponding disaggregate. If an AGY W has already \\ncompleted a DREAMS service/intervention while in DREAMS, she should be reported \\nunder one of the layering disaggregates indicating service completion. For example, if an \\nAGYW has completed HTS but is in process of completing a multi-session prevention \\ncurriculum at Q2 (and has not yet completed the primary package), she should be counted'),\n",

Specific services received by AGYW will continue to be counted under \\nPP_PREV, OVC_SERV, HTS_TST, PREP_NEW, PREP_CT, PMTCT_STAT, GEND_GBV, \\nKP_PREV, etc. as appropriate. Furthermore, AGYW enrolled in DREAMS and receiving \\nDREAMS services should be counted under this indicator regardless of the intervention(s) \\nfunding the services that they received. For example, if an AGYW is enrolled in DREAMS \\nand receives HIV testing, education support, and PrEP in the reporting period, she would be \\ncounted under HTS_TST, PREP_NEW, PREP_CT, and OVC_SERV if she meets the \\ndefinition of each respective indicator. She would also be counted under AGYW_PREV \\nunder the appropriate layering and time in DREAMS disaggregates to track if she has \\nreceived the age-appropriate primary package of DREAMS services/interventions. \\n \\nActive DREAMS participants ages 10-17 years that receive eligible OVC service(s) and who \\nare not otherwise enrolled in the OVC Comprehensive program should be counted under \\nthe O C_SER  “DREAMS” disaggregate (see O C_SER  reference sheet). An illustrative \\nlist of eligible services can be found in Appendix E (e.g. education support, primary \\nprevention of HIV and violence intervention, etc.). AGYW meeting this definition should be \\nreported under both AGYW_PREV and the OVC_SERV DREAMS disaggregate regardless \\nof partner or funding type. \\n \\nAGYW_PREV was not created to measure or show the impact of DREAMS, it was created \\nto monitor fidelity to layering and to assess DREAMS implementation on the ground. \\nDREAMS country teams should review multiple data sources (i.e., ongoing analyses per th e \\nDREAMS Program Completion and Saturation Document) along with AGYW_PREV to \\nevaluate overall DREAMS program performance and coverage.  \\n \\nResults from this indicator will be used to ensure that layering of DREAMS services is \\nhappening across agencies and partners within DREAMS districts and will be used to make \\nprogrammatic decisions to ensure comprehensive, patient-centered prevention \\nprogramming for AGYW. AGYW_PREV results will help field teams and HQ answer several \\nessential questions related to DREAMS programming, quality, and reach, including:  \\n1. How many active DREAMS participants are in the DREAMS program?  \\n2. Is layering happening as intended for all AGYW receiving DREAMS services? Are there \\nspecific services/interventions that are not reaching AGYW as intended? Are there \\nspecific SNUs where layering is stronger or weaker? Are there specific age bands \\nwhere layering is stronger or weaker? \\n3. How does layering change over the time a girl is enrolled in DREAMS?  \\na. Benchmark: Have 90% of active DREAMS participants completed at \\nleast the primary package after being in DREAMS for 13+ months? \\nb. How long is it taking for AGYW (by age band) to complete the primary \\npackage? (e.g. we would not expect AGYW in the younger age bands to \\ncomplete the primary package in <6 months)   \\n4. Where are active DREAMS participants along the DREAMS program completion \\ncontinuum?  \\nPlease refer to the “Data  isualization & Use” section below for example visualizations of \\nAG W_PRE . Each OU’s DREAMS service package and completion definitions differ, as \\ndo their program cycles for enrollment and DREAMS program completion. Therefore, direct \\ncomparisons between OUs should not be made without understanding the contextual \\ncomponents of their DREAMS programs. \\nHow to collect:   This indicator should be reported only in SNUs where approved, DREAMS -funded \\nactivities are occurring.

It captures information about whether FP \\nintegration is occurring at various HIV service delivery points within PEPFAR  supported \\nsites. Many PEPFAR sites will have numerous service delivery points within each site. For \\nexample, if one hospital receives PEPFAR support for both the HIV treatment department \\nAND the ANC department, and both provide family planning services, then the FPINT_SITE \\ntotal for that one site is 2 service delivery points.  \\n \\nThis indicator will enable PEPFAR stakeholders to:  \\n• Gain a basic, but essential, understanding of whether FP services are being integrated \\nin PEPFAR-supported service delivery points.  \\n• Identify gaps, including service contexts, countries, or regions with low levels of HIV/FP \\nintegration. \\n \\nInherent within this indicator is the principle that integrated HIV/FP program activities must \\nrespect a client’s right to make informed decisions about his or her reproductive life. This \\nmeans that clients should have access to an appropriate and comprehensive range of \\ncontraceptive options; and/or to safer conception/pregnancy counseling depending upon \\ntheir fertility desire and intentions. Judgments and personal opinions are not appropriate in \\na clinic setting. \\n \\nThis indicator will be used to monitor coverage of HIV/FP integration at a global level. \\nTherefore, detailed information on completion of referrals, FP service uptake, types \\nof contraceptive methods offered on site, and other critical components of integrated \\nprograms will not be captured through this indicator but should be maintained at the \\nsite or programmatic level.  \\nHow to collect:   Definition: Voluntary Family Planning Service Provision  \\nTo be considered as a PEPFAR-supported service delivery point that directly provides fully \\nintegrated voluntary FP services, all 3 criteria below must be met. If a service delivery point \\nprovides fewer than 3 of the services noted below, it should not be counted under this \\nindicator.  \\n \\nThe PEPFAR-supported HIV service delivery point must provide for all relevant clients, \\nincluding partners in HIV discordant couples (as documented by standard operating \\nprocedures, guidelines, protocols, manuals and/or intake documents, etc.):  \\n \\n1.

It is very much preferred for methods to be available onsite. If \\nreferrals are given, they must include detailed information (e.g., facility location, hours \\nof operation, etc.) about where methods can be accessed. \\n \\nAssess Voluntary Family Planning Needs Through Screening (Number 1 above):  In \\nassessing FP needs, all clients as part of their routine care visit should be asked about their \\nFP needs and practices. Depending upon the individual client and his or her needs, these \\ncan include: reproductive goals; prior pregnancies; living and family situation; FP \\nknowledge; previously used FP methods and satisfaction with use; and any FP-related \\nconcerns. These needs should be assessed without expressing any personal biases about \\na client’s preference.  \\n \\nProvide Voluntary Family Planning Counseling (including Safe Pregnancy Counseling) \\n(Number 2 above): Quality voluntary FP counseling should cover a wide range of topics that \\nare client and context specific, and that include both safe pregnancy counseling for \\nindividuals who wish to become pregnant as well as contraception for individuals  who wish \\nto avoid, space or delay pregnancy. “FP counseling” is not the same as \"FP education\". \\nDepending upon the type of FP services that are offered at PEPFAR supported site; health \\nproviders or community mobilizers may provide EDUCATION and/or COUNSEL ING on FP. \\n \\nEducation activities may include distribution of printed materials, group health education \\nand community outreach efforts among other interventions. Education helps to increase \\ngeneral knowledge on the benefits and importance of FP and increase support for FP use, \\nas well as to link women and their partners to other FP services, including contraceptive \\nmethod provision. \\n  \\nFP counseling is an interpersonal communication between the health provider and client \\nwhere topics specific to the clients’ needs are discussed to help them determine if they want \\nto use FP and if so; to help them choose and use the FP method of their choice. HIV \\nservice providers or all levels can be trained and supported to develop or improve their \\nskills at FP counseling. A wide array of FP counseling materials exist that can be used in \\nPEPFAR settings; including national FP flipcharts, counseling cards and informational \\nhandouts \\n \\nProvision or Referral of a Broad Range of Modern Contraceptive Methods (Number 3 \\nabove): Per U.S. Government legislation, and in line with national FP policies, a broad \\nrange of methods should be provided to clients, allowing them to choose the method most \\nappropriate for them, either directly or through referral. For an SDP to be counted towards \\nthis indicator, at least three modern contraceptive methods should be available either on \\nsite or through referral. Emergency contraception is an important FP method that should be \\navailable in all HIV settings as part of FP and gender-based violence (GBV) services. \\nInformation on modern contraceptive methods can be found in the references listed at the \\nend of this sheet. All referrals should include detailed information about where methods can \\nbe accessed (e.g., facility location, operating hours, etc.).  \\n \\nSpecial Considerations:  \\nUSG-supported FP and HIV/AIDS programs must adhere to the following principles:  \\n• People living with HIV (PLHIV) and their partners should be provided with information \\non and be able to exercise voluntary choices about their health, including their sexual \\nand reproductive health.  \\n• The USG, including PEPFAR, supports a person‘s right to choose, as a matter of \\nprinciple, the number, timing, and spacing of their children, as well as use of FP \\nmethods, regardless of HIV/AIDS status.  \\n• FP use should always be a choice, made freely and voluntarily, independent of the \\nperson‘s HI  status.'),\n",

There can be one or more service delivery points (SDPs) within a single PEPFAR \\nsupported site. Many PEPFAR supported sites will have numerous service delivery points \\nwithin each site.

These SDPs can include fixed locations and/or mobile operations offering \\nroutine and/or regularly scheduled services. Please note, if a site has multiple locations to \\nsupport one HIV service, only one SDP should be reported.

Consequently, \\ndata for this indicator can be generated by counting the number of individuals who are \\ncurrently receiving MAT or received at least 6 months of MAT in the reporting period in \\naccordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) at \\nthe end of the reporting period. \\n \\nCount all individuals who have completed at least 6 months of MAT even if they drop-out, \\ndie, or experience interruption in t, as long as they completed the minimum of 6 months \\nMAT within the reporting period. Do not count individuals who initiate treatment too late in \\nthe reporting period to be able to reach a minimum of 6 months by the time of reporting.  \\nHow to review for data \\nquality: \\nThis indicator makes use of program data as part of an on-going cohort. The MAT register \\nand/or patient-level data can be used to determine the number of people starting MAT in \\nthe defined period, as a cohort, and the number of those who are still in treatment 6 months \\nand who were on MAT for at least six months during the reporting period. \\n  \\nData should be reviewed regularly for the purposes of program management, to monitor \\nprogress towards achieving targets, and to identify and correct any data quality issues.  \\nHow to calculate \\nannual total: N/A.

This de-duplication is critical to accurately track the ANNUAL number of unique \\nindividuals reached by PEPFAR within a given fiscal year. Trend analysis of past performance \\nof KP_PREV data will be adversely affected with the change in frequency of KP_PREV \\nreporting from annually to semi-annually if this de-duplication is ignored (i.e., annual number of \\nKP_PREV reported within the same fiscal year would be inflated as the same individual would \\nbe counted twice if this de-duplication does not occur at Q4 reporting). \\n \\nIf possible, a unique identifier can be assigned.

Example scenarios are below: \\n● A 14-year-old girl is enrolled in the OVC Comprehensive Program, is an active DREAMS \\nparticipant, and has completed an approved primary prevention of HIV and sexual \\nviolence intervention.

He should be \\nreported exclusively under the “O C Comprehensive” disaggregate. The partner \\nimplementing the OVC Preventive program should not report this participant under \\nOVC_SERV because he is already being reported under OVC_SERV through the partner \\nimplementing the OVC Comprehensive program. \\n● A 13-year-old girl is an active DREAMS participant, completes an approved primary \\nprevention of HIV and sexual violence intervention, and is NOT enrolled in the OVC \\nComprehensive Program. She should be reported exclusively under the “DREAMS” \\ndisaggregate when she completes her first OVC_SERV eligible service (see Appendix E). \\nShe should also be counted under AGYW_PREV.

He should be \\nreported exclusively under the “O C Preventive” disaggregate.

Although every attempt should be made to support priority \\npopulations with HIV testing as part of the package of HIV prevention services and to \\nprovide HIV testing on site or PP-friendly sites, programs should also respect the \\nautonomy of clients to decline this service. Clients who decline testing and/or referral \\ncan still receive other prevention services, if the benefits of HIV testing were explained \\nand testing or a referral for testing was offered. \\n• Test not required based on risk assessment: Persons who, based on screening or a \\nrisk assessment, do not require a test for HIV during the reporting period.

This level of elevated risk has been seen among \\nserodiscordant couples with inconsistent condom use when the partner living with HIV is not \\nvirally suppressed or when there are partners outside of the main relationship, pregnant and \\nbreastfeeding women, people in prison or other closed settings, men who have sex with \\nmen (MSM), transgender people (TG), sex workers (SW) of all genders, and people who \\ninject drugs (PWID), as well as adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in many parts \\nof sub-Saharan Africa. PEPFAR supports WHO guidelines on the use of oral PrEP as part \\nof a package of comprehensive structural, biomedical and behavioral prevention services.  \\nAdditional biomedical PrEP products are becoming available and recently WHO guidelines \\nalso recommend the vaginal PrEP ring be offered as an additional prevention choice for \\nwomen at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination prevention approaches. In \\nmost settings, oral PrEP and new PrEP products will be integrated into existing prevention \\nor treatment services for the target population.   \\n \\nAs PEPFAR continues to scale up PrEP service delivery, monitoring the PrEP cascade will \\nbe important to understand which populations are using this prevention intervention, as well \\nas their length of time using it and their HIV outcome. Understanding the PrEP cascade by \\npopulation will help improve implementation strategies for those in highest incidence \\ncommunities initiating PrEP and the strategies for supporting continuity of PrEP.  \\nHow to collect:   The numerator can be generated by counting the number of established PrEP clients that \\nreturned for a follow-up visit during the reporting period.

In this context, index testing refers to any HIV testing of the \\ncontacts of an index client (i.e., a person known to be HIV positive). Only the following \\npersons count as contacts: current or past sexual partner(s), biological children \\n/parents (if index case is a child) or anyone with whom a needle was shared. \\nBiological children reported under HTS_INDEX should only include children of an HIV -\\npositive mother. Children of male-index clients (fathers) should only be included when the \\nbiological mother is HIV-positive, she is deceased, or her HIV status is not known or not \\ndocumented. Conversely, if the index client is the child, his/her mother should be tested, \\nand if the mother is HIV-positive or deceased, the father should be tested as well. In \\naddition, all biologic siblings of the index child should be tested. In this way, provision of \\nindex testing services is non-directional, whereby we are trying to follow transmission of the \\ndisease. Every newly diagnosed individual becomes a subsequent index client from whom \\nto elicit contacts. Like HTS_TST and HTS_SELF, HTS_INDEX is reported at the facility and \\ncommunity levels.  \\n \\nTesting of persons who have not had exposure through an index client, such as neighbors \\nor family members (e.g., children of HIV-negative mother, grandparents, etc.) not born to \\nthe index, should not be reported under HTS_INDEX. Testing of non-contacts should be \\nreported under the modality that best reflects the service delivery point where testing \\noccurred. For example, if HIV testing were conducted in a mobile clinic, unexposed contacts \\nwould be reported under the ‘Mobile’ modality of HTS_TST.  \\n \\nAll index testing services must meet WHO’s 5C minimum standards, including consent, \\ncounseling, confidentiality, correct test results, and connection to HIV prevention (for both \\nHIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals), and HIV care and treatment (often referred to as \\n‘linkage’, for HI -positive individuals). The 5 C’s are essential for all HTS, especially in the \\ncontext of identifying contacts for HIV testing. Additionally, all index clients should be \\nscreened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) per WHO guidelines. An index client should \\nnever feel as if they are required to provide contacts in order to receive any services. \\nOverall, all index testing services being offered at all PEPFAR-supported sites should \\nadhere to PEPFAR’s Guidance on Implementing Safe and Ethical Index Testing Services.'),\n",

The index \\nclient provides the age (<15 or >15) and sex (male or female) of the contact(s). Since \\nthe index client ‘self-reports’ these data, the contact’s recorded age and/or sex does not \\nneed to be corrected in Step 3 if differing age/sex information is collected in Step 4. As \\nmentioned above, contacts are only sexual partners, biological children/parents, and \\nanyone with whom a needle was shared.  \\n4. How many contacts were tested for HIV and received their results? Of those tested \\nand received their results, how many tested positive and negative? This is the number \\nof contacts who were tested for HIV and received their results (positive and negative). \\nThe positive and negative disaggregations do not include the contact’s self-reported \\nstatus; only the actual provision of an HIV test to the contact. However, please note that \\nprevious or known positives are also recorded as “known positive” in Step 4. Known \\npositives should not be retested. \\nChildren of index contacts who have a documented negative test (not a self-test) can be \\nreported as “documented negative with no other HI  exposure risk” (documented \\nnegative). Children reported in this category should have received a final negative HIV \\ntest at 18 months of age or 3 months after breastfeeding ended, whichever occurred \\nlater. Children who received a negative HIV test after this time may also be counted. \\nChildren with any known or suspected HIV exposure should be retested, including but \\nnot limited to: breastfeeding from an HIV-positive mother, known or suspected sexual \\nactivity, contact or abuse, needle stick exposure (unsafe injection practices) or throu gh \\na blood transfusion. If a child is reported to have received a negative test in the past but \\nthe documentation is missing or unavailable, the child should be retested rather than \\nwaiting to retrieve the documentation. The documented negative disaggregat e applies \\nonly to index contacts in the pediatric age bands (<15y years of age). All index contacts \\n≥15 years of age who are not known positive should receive an HIV test, regardless of \\nwhether they are a child of an index case or other type of contact.'),\n",

That is, other data may need to be collected and use d by the \\nprogram to ensure efficient and effective implementation of index testing services either at \\nthe facility or community level. For example, to have a more accurate denominator for \\ncontacts tested, programs may also collect information about the number of contacts \\nreached among the contacts elicited. Furthermore, of those contacts reached, how many \\nagreed to test for HIV? Programs may also wish to disaggregate the numbers of contacts \\nreached and tested by the four different approaches to index testing (e.g., client, dual, \\ncontract, and provider) to see which approaches are most effective. Programs could also \\ntrack the number of newly diagnosed partners and children linked to HIV treatment.  \\nHow to collect:   The suggested data source is a designated HIV Index Testing Services register or logbook. \\nThis will allow easier collection of the data for each step in the index testing cascade shown \\nabove (see Steps 1-4 above). Alternatively, existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting \\nforms already in use to capture HTS can be revised to include the steps mentioned above \\nand the updated disaggregation categories. Examples of data collection forms include client \\nintake forms, activity report forms, or health registers such as HTS registers, health \\ninformation systems, and non-governmental organization records.  \\n \\nOther important considerations for reporting on high-fidelity index testing services: \\n \\n• For a contact to be counted under Step 4, he/she must be tested for HI V and receive \\ntheir result or be a known positive. That contact could either self-report a known \\nexposure to someone with HIV as their reason for testing, have an index testing \\nreferral letter/card/coupon given to them from their HIV-positive partner/family member \\n(client-referral approach), or have been identified during the elicitation process and \\ncontacted by a provider.

For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV test performed at the community- or \\nfacility- level must be confirmed with a second and third (in some contexts) test, which \\nmay be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test is \\nperformed at a different facility, then this may require follow-up by implementing \\npartners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on the Step 4.  \\n• For children <1, only if serologic tests used for diagnostic purposes should they be \\nreported under HTS_INDEX. Serologic tests for screening infants should be excluded \\n(including tests to look for HIV exposure at age 9 months or another time point). For \\nexample, you may use the HTS_INDEX <1 disaggregate to report negative diagnostic \\nresults if a serologic-based test is used to confirm the absence of HIV infection in \\ninfants <1-year-old who have not breastfed for at least 3 months prior to testing. \\nHowever, since diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is typically based on virologic, and \\nnot serologic tests, the general expectation is not to see results in the “<1” \\ndisaggregate of the HTS_INDEX indicator. HIV virologic testing of HIV-exposed infants \\nshould be counted under PMTCT_EID. \\n• Programs that utilize the ‘dual-referral’ approach (i.e., the provider/counselor sits with \\nan index client and their partner(s) to assist with disclosure and/or partner testing) may \\nwant to offer re-testing to the index client to protect his or her safety. In this case, the \\nindex client’s test result should NOT be counted again under HTS_INDEX or \\nHTS_TST. Individuals who undergo couples testing (i.e., neither partner knows their \\nstatus) should be counted under HTS_TST and the appropriate service delivery \\nmodality should be indicated (e.g., ANC). \\n• The partner elicitation process of index testing is a continuous process. \\nProviders/counselors should follow local SOPs to determine when PLHIV are asked \\nagain about any new partners or previous partners that may not have been disclosed \\nby the index client previously. That is, for Step 3 on ‘Contacts Elicited’, contacts may \\nnot be elicited all in one session with the HTS counselor. Elicitation may even continue \\ninto the next reporting quarter.  \\n• Some of the contacts tested in Step 4, may not have been part of the elicitation \\nprocess in Step 2 and Step 3. Contacts may choose to come forward themselves after \\na discussion with the index client (for example). Regardless, any contact who is tested \\nfor HIV should be counted under Step 4.  \\n• Retesting for verification of HIV positive status before or at antiretroviral (ART) initiation \\nshould not be counted under HTS_INDEX. Retesting for verification is primarily \\nconducted as a quality assurance activity to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure those \\ninitiated on ART are indeed HIV positive. Therefore, retesting for verification should \\nonly be conducted for persons who have received an HIV diagnosis, but have not yet \\nbeen initiated on ART.  \\n \\nPlease refer to HTS_TST for information on Data Quality and reporting \\nconsiderations that would also apply here.  \\n \\nKey Populations:  \\nProvision of data (on any of the steps outlined above) specific to key populations (FSW, \\nMSM, Transgender people, PWID, and people in prisons and other closed settings) who \\nwere tested and received their results should be included but not disaggregated into a \\nseparate ‘KP’ disaggregate. That is, there is no separate Key Population disaggregate \\nrequested (unlike HTS_TST). The first priority of data collection and reporting of testing for \\nthe index client and their contacts, particularly key populations, must be to do no harm. \\nThese data must be managed confidentially to ensure the identities of individuals are \\nprotected and to prevent further stigma and discrimination of key populations.

Incorporation of rapid tests for recent HIV-1 infection (RTRI) \\ninto routine HIV testing services will facilitate the establishment of a surveillance system to \\nquickly detect, monitor, and characterize recent infections among newly diagnosed HIV cases. \\nData from a recent infection surveillance system contribute to data-driven approaches to fine-\\ntune a country’s programmatic response through prioritized programming and resource \\nallocation. \\n \\nRecommended use of this indicator is described below.

Results may also be used to monitor epidemic \\ntrends over time. \\n• Public Health Program Response: Monitoring the number and percentage of recent \\ninfections by facility and community can be used to identify areas with ongoing active \\ntransmission, in order to quickly target education, prevention, and testing resources to \\nincrease case finding, intensify index testing services, ensure timely ART linkage and \\nretention, and subsequently interrupt disease transmission. Disaggregation by age, sex, \\nmodality, and key population type can further identify subpopulations at higher risk to \\ninform program planning and implementation. Changes over time should be monitored to \\nassess program impact.  \\n• Program Implementation: The indicator may be used to monitor the rollout of testing for \\nrecent infection. A crude estimate of testing coverage may be calculated using: \\nHTS_RECENT by applicable age/sex bands divided by HTS_TST_POS by applicable \\nage/sex bands.

This is often done in a \\nprivate setting, either alone or with a trusted person. HIV self-testing is a screening test \\nand requires self-testers with a reactive (preliminary positive) result to receive further testing \\nfrom a trained provider using a validated national testing algorithm. HIV self-testing \\napproaches range from unassisted self-testing (with limited or no instruction provided) to \\ndirectly assisted self-testing (where a testing provider demonstrates how to use the self-test \\nkit). Self-test kits can be distributed in various ways (i.e., by providers or outreach workers, \\nover-the-counter, etc.). Secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits may also occur (e.g., to \\npartners of ANC attendees, or clients of FSWs). \\n \\nThis indicator aims to monitor trends in the distribution of HIV self-test kits within a country \\nat the lowest distribution point (i.e., between the distributer and the intended \\nuser(s)/recipient). The implementation of HIV self-testing programs should facilitate and \\nenhance access to and uptake of HIV testing services for populations where HIV test \\nuptake is low and undiagnosed HIV infection is high (i.e., men, adolescents/young adults, \\nand key populations). \\nHow to collect:   The suggested data source is a (newly developed) HIVST (HIV self-test) register or \\nlogbook. This will minimize any potential confusion with HTS_TST data collection and \\nreporting since HIV self-testing is only a screening test and should not be reported under \\nHTS_TST which only includes diagnostic testing. If a standalone HIVST register or logbook \\nis not possible, revise existing HTS registers, log books, and reporting forms already in use \\nto include very clear labels to indicate self-testing to prevent information entered in an HTS \\nregister from being counted and reported under HTS_TST or HTS_TST_POS.  \\n \\nNote that one individual can receive multiple self-test kits (e.g., one for themselves and one \\nfor their partner or partners). Data for the numerator should be generated by counting \\nthe number of individual HIV self-test kits distributed and NOT the number of \\nindividuals receiving an HIV self-test kit. Number of self-test kits distributed should be \\ncaptured and reported at the lowest distribution point. The lowest distribution point refers to \\nthe individual/site giving out self-test kits and capturing data for monitoring purposes. This is \\nto prevent double counting between the various higher supply chain levels.  \\n \\nFor example, the central warehouse distributes 500 self-test kits to an implementing \\npartner doing outreach for KPs. The implementing partner gives their peer outreach workers \\na total of 50 self-test kits to give out during an outreach event. The outreach workers return \\nfrom their event having given out 30 self-test kits. In this scenario, the lowest distribution \\npoint would be the outreach workers who are capturing the monitoring data. Therefore, the \\nnumber of tests kits distributed would be 30. Each of these lowest distribution counts should \\nbe rolled up (aggregated) to create the numerator for this indicator.'),\n",

The findings can support national government and PEPFAR programs to \\nassess how efficient different distribution approaches are at reaching tar get populations. \\nThese data may also be useful for projecting programmatic commodities (e.g., self -test kits) \\nand systems needs (e.g., staffing resources). It is important to note that for the purposes of \\nthis indicator, it is assumed that the tests distributed to individuals and counted in the \\ndirectly assisted self-testing model are the used by individuals that received them so the \\ndisaggregation for “test kit distributed for use by” is not requested in the directly assisted \\nmodel. Please refer to the example clarification below for additional details. \\n \\nFor example, if an 18-year-old female reports to a testing site and receives a one-on-one \\ntesting demonstration for herself – the test for herself will be reported as directly assisted \\nand you would provide the age/sex disaggregation data for one test kit distributed in the 15-\\n19-year-old age band. When she leaves the clinic, she takes two additional test kits along \\nwith her: one for her sex partner and one for her friend to use at a later time. The two test  \\nkits for her sex partner and friend would be counted as unassisted. For the age/sex \\nbreakdown under unassisted, 2 tests would go in the 15-19-year-old female age band \\nbecause two tests were distributed to the female in that age band. The reporting follows \\nthe distribution of the test kits and not the age/sex demographics of the end user of \\nthe self-test kit. For the “test kit distributed for use by” disaggregate, you would indicate a \\n‘1’ in the ‘sex partner’ disaggregate for the test she planned to distribute to her sex partner \\nand a ‘1’ in the ‘other’ disaggregate for the test she planned to distribute to her friend. \\n \\nIt is understood that registers and procedures for HIVST are still relatively new in many \\nPEPFAR countries and specific distribution methods (e.g., vending machines) may not \\nalways allow for collection of detailed data on self-test kit distribution. As such, the only \\nrequired disaggregate for this indicator will be for the type of self-testing (i.e., directly-\\nassisted vs. unassisted). In addition, age/sex demographic information for test kits \\ndistributed using the directly-assisted self-testing model will also be required as these \\nindividuals should have received an in-person HIV test kit demonstration and demographic \\ninformation should be collected at that time \\n \\nNote: Although not required, implementing partners should attempt to document and report \\ninformation about actual use of self-test kits. This includes who used the test kit, the test \\nresult from the self-test and linkage to retesting (if result is reactive), particularly when \\ndirectly assisted HIVST occurs.

However, since diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is based on virologic and not \\nserologic tests, the general expectation is not to see results in the “< 1” disaggregate of the \\nHTS_INDEX indicator.

Therefore, retesting for verification should only be performed for \\npersons who have received an HIV diagnosis but have not yet been initiated on ART.

This indicator counts the number of individuals tested not the number of tests \\nconducted. All efforts should be made to ensure data are collected on individuals tested \\nvs. number of tests conducted through de-duplication. Within HTS registers, collecting \\ndata on the following variables should be considered to help in these efforts:  \\na. Retesting status: new tester, re-tester (i.e., tested in the last 3 months), \\nretesting to verify an HIV-positive diagnosis before ART initiation \\nb. HIV testing services - *HIV test results, date of HIV test, receipt of HIV test \\nresults, previously tested during the reporting period \\nc. Demographic - Client’s Unique ID, name, *sex, and *age at time of HTS \\nservices \\nd. Date HIV-positive individual was linked to treatment  \\ne. Site - *site name and ID, district, region, province, and *service delivery \\nmodality \\n2. Using unique identifiers for individuals is one way to account for retesting and avoid \\ndouble reporting if electronic systems are available to easily link data through these \\nunique identifiers. Another approach is to record information about prior testing on the \\nHTS client register. \\n3. For an individual to be counted under HTS_TST, their HIV diagnosis must be confirmed \\nusing a nationally validated testing algorithm. For example, an HIV-positive rapid HIV \\ntest performed at the community- or facility- level must be confirmed with a second test, \\nwhich may be performed at the same site or at a different facility. If the confirmatory test \\nis performed at a different facility, then this may entail follow-up by implementing \\npartners to confirm the diagnosis before reporting on this indicator. The implementing \\npartner who first identified and tested the individual should report on HTST_TST under \\nthe appropriate modality; however, that implementing partner must ensure that the \\ndiagnosis of the individual tested is confirmed. That is, only a confirmed diagnosis \\n(positive or negative) counts under HTS_TST regardless of the modality used for \\nreporting. Similarly, simply only confirming the diagnosis of an individual who has \\nalready been tested (as per the national testing algorithm) does not fulfill the \\nrequirements for reporting on HTS_TST regardless of the modality used. \\n4.

A single person should only be counted once under any given modality. \\n \\nService delivery modalities are defined as: \\n  \\nCommunity-based testing: Applies to any testing done outside of a designated health \\nfacility. Within community-based testing, the following disaggregates are available:  \\nA. Index: Importantly, the index modality under HTS_TST will auto-populate from \\nHTS_INDEX (see HTS_INDEX reference sheet for more information). Index testing, \\nalso referred to as partner testing/partner notification services, is an approach whereby \\nthe exposed contacts (i.e., sexual partners, biological children and anyone with whom a \\nneedle was shared) of an HIV-positive person (i.e., index client), are elicited and offered \\nHIV testing services. That is, in this context, Index testing refers to any HIV testing of \\ncontacts of an index client (i.e., a known positive). Only the following persons count \\nas contacts: current or past sexual partner(s), biological children /parents (if \\nindex case is child) or anyone with whom a needle was shared. Biological \\nchildren reported under HTS_INDEX should only include children of an HIV-\\npositive mother and children of male-index clients (fathers) whose biological \\nmother is HIV-positive, deceased, or her HIV status is not known or not \\ndocumented. Conversely, if the index client is the child, his/her mother should be \\ntested, and if positive or deceased, the father should be tested as well. In this way, \\nprovision of index testing services is non-directional, whereby we are trying to follow \\ntransmission of the disease, and every newly identified positive becomes a subsequent \\nindex client from whom to elicit contacts. While testing the contacts of an index client \\nmay occur in mobile, VCT or other community testing venue, this testing should be \\nreported under HTS_INDEX. That is, if an individual could be reported under both \\nHTS_INDEX and another HTS_TST modality, that individual should only be reported \\nonce under HTS_INDEX. Again, the index modality under HTS_TST will auto-populate \\nfrom HTS_INDEX (see HTS_INDEX reference sheet for more information). \\nB. Mobile: Testing in Mobile ad hoc or temporary testing locations, such as community \\ncenters, schools, workplaces, and includes testing in mobile unit such as tents and \\nvans. Testing related to VMMC services is not included here and should be reported \\nunder facility based VMMC modality.  \\nC. SNS (Social Network Strategies): Social network strategies are a set of distinct case-\\nfinding approaches that use individuals' (i.e. PLHIV or key populations) high -risk \\nnetwork connections to refer individuals for HIV testing. These approaches, which \\ninclude enhanced peer outreach approach (EPOA), leverage social, sexual, and drug -\\nusing relationships or behaviors to reach high risk and hidden individuals who may \\nbenefit from HIV testing that may otherwise not be captured under traditional testing \\nmodalities (e.g., VCT, PITC, or index testing). Programs that have used other \\nmodalities (i.e. VCT, other community, index testing) to previously report SNS should \\nnow report individuals referred for HIV testing via a referral under the SNS modality. \\nIndividuals who agree to both Index testing and SNS should be carefully tracked to \\nensure accurate reporting. If a named contact elicited via the index testing process \\nreturns with an SNS coupon the contact should be reported under index testing (either \\nfacility or community). For example, a newly diagnosed individual agrees to index \\ntesting services and shares information about Partner 1 and Partner 2. The provider \\nalso offers SNS and the index client agrees to recruit individuals in their network. \\nPartner 2 returns to the testing site and has a coupon that is used for SNS. The \\nprovider would record Partner 2 as index testing, not SNS, since this is one of the \\ncontacts that the index client identified during the elicitation process. Note: if site only \\nconducts anonymous testing then site should report test as SNS if client returns with a \\ncoupon. \\nD.

When the implementing partner knows the HIV status, the program \\nshould ensure that the children are linked to appropriate care and treatment services as an \\nessential element of quality case management. OVC programs should also play an important \\nrole in family-centered disclosure, for those who are living with HIV.  \\n \\nThe goal of monitoring OVC_HIVSTAT is to increase the proportion of children in the OVC \\nComprehensive program with a known HIV status or for whom an HIV test is not required \\nbased on a risk assessment. \\n• While OVC partners are encouraged to work with testing and clinical partners wherever \\npossible to confirm HIV and ART status, this indicator is NOT intended to be an indicator of \\nHIV tests performed or receipt of testing results, as these are measured elsewhere . \\n• This indicator is NOT intended to imply that all OVC require an HIV test. OVC with known \\npositive or negative status do not need to be tested. OVC with unknown HIV status should \\nbe assessed for risk, and if determined to be at risk, should be referred or otherwise \\nsupported, to access HTS. For younger children who are determined not to be at risk (“test \\nnot required based on risk assessment”), reassessment of risk will only be needed in cases \\nwhere their risk situation changes (i.e., in cases of child sexual abuse). Older children whom \\nthe IP thinks may be sexually active should be assessed every reporting period. An HIV risk \\nassessment should always occur prior to HIV testing to determine if a test is required.  \\n• Status disclosure to the implementing partner is NOT a prerequisite for enrollment or \\ncontinuation in an OVC program. OVC programs serve persons of positive, negative, and \\nunknown HIV status appropriate to their needs and vulnerability to HIV. This indicat or \\nensures that IPs are regularly providing outreach to caregivers to identify children’s HI  \\nstatus, encouraging family disclosure, and linking to care and treatment services as needed.'),\n",

Testing results \\nfor OVC who are referred for testing should be reported under HTS_TST based on the \\nservice delivery point where they are tested. \\n• This indicator also captures if implementing partners are tracking if the OVC that they serve \\nwho report to be living with HIV are successfully linked to and have continuity of treatment \\nand care. ART treatment status should be recorded both at the time of enrollment  as well as \\nat regular intervals at least once during the reporting period. \\n• Since this is not a testing indicator, HIV positivity yield should NOT be calculated based on \\nthis indicator. Yield calculations should only be made by testing partners.  \\n• A helpful way to assess O C_HI STAT performance is to create a “known status proxy” \\ncategory of known status/risk (by combining those reported positive, negative, and those \\nwho have been risk assessed and found to not require a test) and compare this with the \\nOVC_SER  <18 “O C Comprehensive” disaggregate. This analysis encourages programs \\nto actively follow-up on all instances of “HI  status unknown” by targeting instances of \\nmissing data, nondisclosure, and issues with reporting timing.  \\n• This indicator is a subset of the OVC_SERV Comprehensive program. Only OVC who were \\nreported under the O C_SER  <18 “O C Comprehensive” disaggregate should be \\nreported in the numerator for this indicator.  \\n• In previous MER iterations, DREAMS participants who were reported under OVC_SERV \\nwere reported under OVC_HIVSTAT where feasible. With the denominator change to \\ninclude only OVC Comprehensive program participants, do not count non-Comprehensive \\n(i.e. DREAMS or OVC Preventive) participants in the OVC_HIVSTAT numerator. \\nHow to collect:   Data sources for this indicator include HIV test results that are self-reported by OVC (or their \\ncaregivers), results of HIV Risk Assessments conducted by implementing partners, registers, \\nreferral forms, client records, or other confidential case management and program monitoring \\ntools that track those in treatment and care. Per COP Guidance, OVC and Clinical IPs should \\nwork together as multi-disciplinary teams, including by developing MOUs and data sharing \\nagreements, to ensure that children in need of an HIV test and/or HIV treatment are \\nappropriately served.  \\n \\nImplementation of the HIV risk assessment should be integrated into case management and \\non-going case monitoring, and should not be conducted separately, if possible. This will vary \\nby partner and project. The partners should work out a timeline based on their experience of \\nhow long referral completion and status disclosure usually takes and factor that into their case \\nmanagement processes.  \\n \\nImplementing partners will record the OVC’s self-reported HIV status semi-annually. \\n \\nReporting Scenarios: \\nQ1: Daniel reports to the community health worker (CHW) that he is negative, but his last test \\nwas two y ars ago. Is Dani   sti   r port d as “N gativ ”, or as “No Stat s”, and n  ds to b  \\nrisk assessed?  \\n \\nA1: Based on their knowledge of the child from case management records, if the CHW \\nbelieves that the child has no risk of HIV infection (i.e., no one in the household is HIV+, they \\nare not exposed to violence, child is not sexually active yet) then getting another test done is \\nnot necessary and would report them as “Negative”. This applies mainly to younger children \\nunder age 12 (depends on average age of sexual debut in the country). For adolescents, we \\nrecommend getting risk assessed if the test was not conducted in the reporting period. \\n \\nIn that same scenario, what if the CHW decides to administer the HIV Risk Assessment to \\nDaniel and finds that an HIV test is not indicated, how should that be reported? This should be \\nreported as “Test Not Required Based on Risk Assessment” because once the CHW decides \\nto conduct a risk assessment, this means that the child’s status is in question and should be \\nreported accordingly.'),\n",

If \\nfound at risk (e.g., GBV exposure) then she should be referred for testing. If determined to be \\n“Test Not Required Based on Risk Assessment” Elizabeth would be captured as “Test Not \\nRequired Based on Risk Assessment”.  \\n \\nIf she completes the testing within the reporting period and the caregiver is willing to disclose \\nthe result of the test, her response would be captured accordingly. \\nIf she is risk assessed and referred for testing, but her caregiver is not able/willing to complete \\nthe test or disclose the status within the reporting period it is captured as “No HI  Status”. \\nHopefully by the following reporting period, the caregiver will have completed the referral and \\ndisclosed the child\\'s status so it can be captured as positive or negative.

HIV status and completion of an HIV test are not required \\nfor enrollment in an OVC program. If a child is believed to be at high risk of HIV and the \\ncaregiver is reluctant to disclose results or complete a test, OVC programs should attempt to \\nfacilitate a meeting with the caregiver, and persons specially trained on HIV disclosure.

Until the client chooses to disclose test results, status under \\nO C_HI STAT should be recorded as “No HI  Status.” \\n \\nQ4: How do we report on HIV exposed infants who are still too young to have had their final \\nHIV status testing? \\n \\nA4: Because HIV-exposed infants may be tested at multiple points prior to receiving a final \\nHIV status, we recommend that they be counted as \"no status\" until such time that the clinic \\ndetermines their final status as positive (infected) or negative (not infected). A note can be \\nentered in DATIM in the narrative section indicating the number of children entered as \"no \\nstatus\" that are HIV-exposed (i.e., infants during the reporting period who were of \\nundetermined status).

Reviewing \\ninfants with a first virologic test (N) against these denominator results) should be done \\ncarefully—see assumptions and limitations below. Review of outlier percentages for testing \\ncoverage by age band is recommended (e.g., review high and low outliers for 0-≤2-month \\ntesting coverage disaggregate). \\n \\nAssumption: the total number of HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women, and \\ntherefore HEI, does not significantly vary quarter by quarter.

However, despite that time period mismatch, the assumption is that the \\ntotal number of HIV positive women (estimated HEI) does not vary significantly quarter by \\nquarter, so it is reasonable to compare infants tested to the STAT_POS & HTS_TST_POS \\nPostANC1: Pregnancy/L&D/BF denominator from the same reporting time period. \\n \\nSee the PMTCT_HEI_POS indicator reference sheet for a description of considerations and \\nlimitations in calculating proxy positivity for HEI (PMTCT_HEI_POS / PMTCT_EID).  \\nHow to calculate \\nannual total: Sum results across quarters. \\nDisaggregations: Numerator Disaggregations: \\nDisaggregate Groups Disaggregates \\nInfant Test by Age at \\nSample Collection \\n[Required] \\n• Infants who had a first virologic test (sample collected) \\nbetween birth and 2 months of age (0-≤2mo); \\n• Infants who had a first virologic test (sample collected) \\nbetween 2 and 12 months of age. \\nDenominator Disaggregations: \\nDisaggregate Groups Disaggregates \\nN/A See PMTCT_STAT and HTS_TST. \\nDisaggregate \\ndescriptions & \\ndefinitions: \\nInfant Test by Age at Sample Collection: For the numerator to be calculated, \\nimplementing partners are required to report: \\n• Infants who had a first virologic test (sample collected) between birth and 2 months of \\nage (0-≤2mo):  Age at the time the sample is collected should be reported. \\n• Infants who had a first virologic test (sample collected) between 2 and 12 months of \\nage:  Age at the time the sample is collected should be reported.  \\nPEPFAR-support \\ndefinition:   \\nStandard definition of DSD and TA-SDI used.'),\n",

Notifying caregivers of infant test results remains important. \\n• The infants reported as tested under the revised PMTCT_EID indicator are not \\nnecessarily the same infants whose positive results would be reported under the new \\nHEI_POS indicator. Dividing HEI_POS by PMTCT_EID will not provide a precise \\nmeasure of positivity; however, a proxy positivity could be calculated over a longer time \\nperiod. See “How to Review for Data Quality” for more information. \\nHow to collect:   This indicator should be collected from the clinical source (i.e., HIV-exposed infant registers \\nor patient records) to ensure unduplicated patient counting and patient care. HIV -exposed \\ninfant registers should be used to count HIV-infected infants whose results were returned in \\nthe reporting period and the age at the time of sample collection.

Additional supporting information for this \\nindicator can be obtained from standard laboratory information systems (i.e., DNA PCR or \\nPOC/near POC log books or electronic systems) however, it will be important to ensure that \\nrepeat tests of the same sample or HIV-infected infants receiving a confirmatory virologic \\nHIV test result are not counted twice. Please note that PMTCT_HEI_POS should include all \\nHIV-positive infants identified at the facility in the quarter, regardless of entry point (i.e., not \\njust those identified through the PMTCT entry point). Therefore, a PMTCT clinic may need \\nto compile testing data from other entry points at the facility (e.g., inpatient wards, \\nmalnutrition program) to report accurately and completely on this indicator. \\n \\nOnly HIV-infected infants identified as infected by a virologic HIV test on a sample collected \\nwhen they were between ages 0 through 12 months should be included in this indicator. \\nInfants who initially were identified negative from a first virologic test but who were later \\nidentified as HIV-infected after a later virologic test should be included, as long as the infant \\nwas still aged 12 months or less at the time of sample collection. Currently, the most \\ncommonly used form of virologic testing or nucleic acid testing (“NAT”) is HI  DNA PCR on \\ndried blood spots (DBS) but this indicator also includes HIV-infected infants identified \\nthrough POC testing (e.g., Alere, Xpert).

These values may differ in part because \\nthe age disaggregate definitions for these indicators differs. TX_NEW age is based on \\nage at ART initiation, while PMTCT_HEI_POS is based on age at virologic sample \\ncollection.

There is a risk of double counting, as a pregnant woman \\nreceiving ART at ANC should have multiple visits for each pregnancy. Therefore partners \\nshould ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double \\ncounting of the same pregnant woman across visits including a paper based longitudinal \\nANC or PMTCT register (meaning a register that is able to record all information about 1 \\npregnancy in one location, with rows or columns that allow for recording information on \\nmultiple visits during that pregnancy) or an electronic medical record/patient tracking \\nsystem. There is also a risk of undercounting if those women who are already on ART prior \\nto attending ANC are not documented, therefore the ANC register should document both \\n“New on ART” and “Already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy”. \\n \\nNote: Those women reported in PMTCT_ART including newly enrolled on ART and already \\non ART at the beginning of pregnancy should also be reported in the TX_NEW and \\nTX_CURR indicators, respectively. Women who are already on ART should not be counted \\nin TX_NEW. PMTCT_ART is about initiation of ART (yes/no) or already on ART (yes/no). \\nThis will most likely be captured at ANC1 but may be captured at a future ANC visit. \\nWomen initiated on ART during L&D or breastfeeding should not be reported under \\nPMTCT_ART but should still be reported under TX_NEW. \\nHow to review for data \\nquality: \\nReview any site with over 100% coverage or very low coverage to ensure they reflect \\nexpected results. In general, services should be reported at the site where they are \\ndelivered (however PMTCT_ART- “already on treatment” and PMTCT_STAT_POS “known \\npositive at entry” are exceptions, see details under description of disaggregate below). \\nTherefore, coverage at site level must be understood within the context of the service \\ndelivery model at that site. For example, in local areas where ART is integrated into ANC \\nand low volume PMTCT sites are only testing for HIV and then referring women to other \\nfacilities for ART, the expectation is that for one individual PMTCT_STAT_POS (newly \\ntested) will be documented at one facility and PMTCT_ART (new on ART) would be \\ndocumented at another facility leading to the appearance of greater than >100% coverage \\nat one site and 0% coverage at another. \\nHow to calculate \\nannual total: \\nSum results across quarters for both the numerator and denominator.'),\n",

Patients should also be reported as IIT if they have \\nbeen traced and scheduled to return after the end of the reporting period (in other words, \\nthey have not returned yet).

It is assumed that tracing will be attempted for \\nevery patient who has missed clinical visits at both <28 days and >28 days since the last \\nexpected clinical contact or ARV pick-up. \\n \\nThis indicator seeks to reconcile the status of patients who are TX_CURR during the \\nreporting period and then fall off of ART, i.e., into the classification of >28 day since clinical \\ncontact or ARV pick-up status DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. This includes those \\nART patients who continue treatment from the prior reporting period (TX_CURR at the \\nbeginning of the reporting period), and those who newly initiate in this reporting period \\n(TX_NEW). To reiterate, this indicator should not count or report those patients who were \\nalready lost and not counted in TX_CURR at the beginning of the reporting period.  \\n \\nIf a patient is re-engaged and restarted ART after >28 days of being off treatment, and \\nremains on treatment until the end of the reporting period, then the patient should be added \\nback to TX_CURR, but should not be counted in TX_ML.

Facilities should make every attempt to \\ncontinue to contact persons who experienced IIT from a prior reporting period and return \\nthem to care, an outcome which would be reflected in the TX_RTT indicator.  \\n \\nNote that TX_ML requires that a patient is on treatment at the beginning of the reporting \\nperiod or newly initiates treatment during the reporting period, while TX_RTT requires t hat a \\npatient is not on treatment at the beginning of the reporting period and excludes patients \\nwho newly initiate treatment during the reporting period. Therefore, a patient cannot be \\ncounted in TX_ML and TX_RTT in the same reporting period.  \\n \\nBoth TX_ML and TX_RTT have disaggregates on interruption in treatment. The TX_ML IIT \\ndisaggregate reflects the amount of time that a patient was on treatment when they \\nexperienced an interruption in treatment. The TX_RTT IIT disaggregate reflects the duration \\nof interruption in treatment prior to being returned to treatment.  \\n \\nSee Appendix J for a visual representation of TX_CURR, TX_ML, TX_NEW, and TX_RTT.  \\nIt is widely acknowledged that even where reporting is required, mortality data, especially \\ncause of death, are often underreported or inaccurate.

Additionally, a patient should not have been counted under TX_CURR in \\nthe previous reporting period. The reason for not being counted under TX_CURR in the \\nprevious reporting period could include having experienced IIT in the previous reporting \\nperiod, having experienced IIT at an earlier time point, or having stopped/refused treatment.  \\n \\nA newly initiated patient who experiences IIT and is returned to treatment within the same \\nreporting period should not be counted in TX_RTT.

This allows ART prog rams \\nto monitor individual and overall programmatic response to ART as measured by virologic \\nsuppression. This indicator will provide data on patients who have a viral load (VL) test in \\nthe past 12 months and the percentage who were virally suppressed at the most recent \\ntest. \\n \\nVL TESTING COVERAGE: \\nComparison of the denominator for this indicator with the result for TX_CURR from 6 \\nmonths earlier (i.e., two quarters prior) can be used to crudely estimate VL testing coverage \\nsupported by PEPFAR. For example, a comparison may be made between the FY20 Q1 \\ndenominator for TX_PVLS and FY19 Q3 TX_CURR, given that patients newly initiating ART \\nand included in TX_CURR in FY19 Q4 and FY20 Q1 may not be eligible for a viral load test. \\nIn calculating this estimate, it is important to ensure that individuals, not tests are being \\nreported for TX_PVLS. VL testing coverage for pregnant women can be estimated by \\ncomparing the TX_PVLS denominator “Pregnant” disaggregate to the sum of the last four \\nquarters of PMTCT_ART “Already on ART” disaggregate. This coverage calculation may \\nunderestimate the number of pregnant women that need a viral load test as it does not \\ninclude pregnant women newly initiating ART. When country level guidance indicates a viral \\nload test for pregnant women newly initiating ART, the coverage denominator should \\ninclude both PMTCT_ART “New on ART” and PMTCT_ART “Already on ART”. \\n \\nAnalyzing both VL testing coverage and suppression rates by geography, sub-population, \\nand implementing mechanisms is essential for program management and quality of care. \\nReal-time review of VL results should trigger an immediate response to follow -up on \\npatients who are not suppressed (i.e., VL ≥1000). \\nHow to collect:   This indicator should be collected from clinical sources (e.g., electronic or paper patient \\nrecords), where possible, to ensure de-duplicated patient counting and receipt of results to \\ninform patient care. Ideally, data for this indicator should be collected from an electronic \\nmedical records system (EMR) to minimize data collection errors and ensure that results \\nare informing patient care. If data collection from an EMR is not possible, indicator data may \\nbe collected from paper-based registers or reports that reflect the VL results.

Timely access to up -to-date \\npatient information plays a vital role in the provision of effective clinical care by health \\nprofessionals. Diagnosis and treatment can be improved if health professionals have easy \\naccess to accurate and comprehensive medical records of patients. \\nHow to collect:   Definition of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR):  \\nAn EMR is a longitudinal electronic record of an individual patient's health information that \\ncan assist health professionals with decision-making and treatment. Data found in a record \\nmay include patient demographics, past medical history, vital signs, examination and \\nprogress notes, medications, allergies, immunizations, laboratory test results, other test \\nresults. It can also support the collection of data for other uses such as quality \\nmanagement, public health disease surveillance and reporting. EMR can include real-time \\npoint-of-care data entry as well as retrospective data entry. An EMR is a digital version of a \\npaper chart that contains key information in a patient’s medical history from one service \\ndelivery point or site.  \\n \\nThe implementing partner should indicate whether the PEPFAR-supported service delivery \\nareas have implemented and are actively using an electronic medical record system to \\nassist clinical service provision or patient/program monitoring and reporting. Specifically, for \\nPEPFAR reporting a minimum of 6 months of retrospective data should be included in the \\nEMR. (For example, an ART EMR set up in September 2018 to contain at least 6 months of \\nretrospective data (current patients that have been enrolled on ART) could be counted in \\nthe reporting at FY18 APR.  \\n \\nIndividual service delivery area/point EMR versus Integrated Health EMR:  \\nEMRs are typically for all health areas, but PEPFAR is interested in better understanding \\nwhether EMRs are available for the service delivery areas where PEPFAR focuses its work. \\nIf a service delivery area is incorporated in a larger integrated health EMR, then it should be \\nincluded this indicator. If two or more service areas are in an integrated EMR, both areas \\nshould be included in this indicator. A site service delivery area should be reported under \\nthis indicator if the EMR is on site (i.e., server and computer entry screen or there is a \\ncentral server at a hub facility, that includes all data from all the “spokes” for that facility’s \\ncatchment area. As long as the data for patient management and reporting comes from the \\nEMR system as one source.\"),\n",

The lack of a sufficient workforce in countries presents a serious \\nchallenge to every area of health.  The data will tell us the number of new health workers \\nwho are available to enter the health workforce each year as a result of PEPFAR support.  \\nHow to collect:   Training under this indicator is defined as “pre-service” training – the training of “new” health \\nworkers (see definition below). Training generally occurs prior to the individual entering the \\nhealth workforce in his or her new position (with the exception of certain training that may \\noccur on-the job but that prepares health workers to function as a new cadre or with an \\nexpanded scope of practice in the health system). A health worker who advances to a \\nhigher cadre (e.g., a clinical assistant who completes training to become a clinical officer) \\nshall be counted as a “new” health worker for the purposes of this indicator. The HRH goal \\nis to expand the number of workers in the workforce and increase access to care through \\nthe advancement of current workers to higher level cadres through additional training and \\neducation.  \\n \\nPre-service training institutions are university-based or affiliated schools of medicine, \\nnursing, public health, social work, laboratory science, pharmacy, and other health -related \\nfields. Non-professional or paraprofessional training would be any accredited and nationally \\nrecognized pre-service program that is a requirement for this cadre’s entry into the \\nworkforce.  \\n \\n“In-service” and “continuing education” training should not be included in the count for this \\nindicator but continue to be encouraged. These types of training may be captured by other \\nindicators within program areas (e.g., supply chain).  \\n \\nIn order to count, the duration of training must meet or exceed a minimum of 6 months. For \\nexample, community health workers who receive a 3-month training course cannot be \\ncounted here. The training duration may be a combination of classroom and practical field \\ntime to arrive at six months.  \\n \\nA pre-service training program must be nationally accredited, or at the minimum meet \\nnational and international standards.

To ensure people living with HIV receive the \\ncare and treatment required to live healthy, productive lives, and to reduce the chance of \\ntransmitting HIV, it is critical that they know their status.

The \\nnumber of deaths among PLHIV must be subtracted from the cumulative number \\ndiagnosed to calculate the number of people living with HIV who know their status.  \\n• Survey-based reporting: \\no Certain population-based surveys include questions about known HV status. \\nAlthough this information may be subject to under-reporting bias, when \\ncombined with survey-related HIV testing it can provide an estimate of known \\nstatus among survey respondents. \\no Many population-based surveys include questions on HIV testing history. These \\nquestions can provide a range for the proportion of PLHIV with known status. \\nThe percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who have been tested in \\nthe past 12 months and received the results provides the upper range of known \\nstatus (there will be a small proportion equal to the annual incidence rate – less \\nthan 2% in most cases – of people who might have converted in the 12 months \\nafter being tested). The percentage of people living with HIV in the survey who \\nhave ever been tested and received the results provides the lower range of \\nknown status. \\no When using survey-based methods, note that:  \\n▪ Household surveys are often restricted to respondents of reproductive age \\n(15– 49), and so may not be representative of people living with HIV <15 \\nyears and >49 years. \\n▪ Because household surveys are typically only done every five years, data \\nfrom non-recent surveys may not reflect current levels of testing coverage. \\nDisaggregations: Numerator Disaggregations: \\nDisaggregate Groups Disaggregates \\nAge/Sex \\n[Required] \\n• <15 F/M, 15+ F/M \\nSex-Only \\n[Conditional, if age/sex \\nreporting is not possible] \\n• Female \\n• Male'),\n",

This tool was developed in collaboration with \\nWHO, UNAIDS, the Global Fund, and PEPFAR to ensure that there is one agreed upon methodology for \\nconducting data quality assessments of treatment numbers. For more information, tools, and examples: \\nplease visit the following link: https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/toolkits/hiv-data-quality-assessment/en/ \\n \\nThe objectives of DQA are: \\n1) to assess the quality of reported data by using standard indicator definitions to recreate the reported \\nnumbers for selected indicators and compare with the numbers reported by the national data collection \\nsystem, such as DHIS2 (District Health Information Software), and by partners; \\n2) to verify the quality of and to improve the reported HIV patient monitoring data and systems at the \\nfacility level; \\n3) to cross-validate a sample of patient records and manually count patient records and describe any \\nsystematic data quality challenges with applied indicator definitions and data recording and to \\nrecommend actions to improve data quality; \\n4) to determine the percentage of people receiving ART nationally over- or undercounted (and sub-\\nnationally when feasible or the country needs this) and use this to reset the numbers at both the site \\nlevel and within the national data collection system in addition to ensuring accurate reporting in any \\nreporting systems moving forward; and \\n5) to update national reporting data and national epidemiological estimates for improved planning. \\n \\nThe DQA requires six steps: \\n1) Setting up a country-based implementation team of stakeholders to agree on the scope and methods \\nand to support the implementation and dissemination of the results of the DQA; \\n2) To agree on the sampling required and the indicators to include in the assessment and to finalize the \\nsite-level instruments; \\n3) Assessing at the site level to collect data, including assessing the HIV patient monitoring system and \\nrecreating the numbers of people receiving and initiating ART; \\n4) Conducting a desk review to identify challenges in national reporting (can take place simultaneously \\nwith step 3); \\n5) Analyzing the results and resetting the site-level and national numbers of people receiving and \\ninitiating ART; and \\n6) Developing a communication strategy and disseminating the updated values. \\n \\nA two-stage phased approach for implementing a DQA is recommended to assist countries in giving priority to \\nscaling up DQA activities over time and to prepare countries to implement larger-scale DQA when significant \\ndata quality issues are identified or when the country needs or wants to review and adjust treatment data at \\nthe subnational level. \\nThe scope of the two phases is as follows. \\n• Phase 1: in the initial phase, the DQA will be implemented within a nationally representative number of \\nART sites in which the six steps indicated above will be implemented with a view to validate the \\nnumber of people on ART and if necessary reset the national ART number as needed, as well as \\nstrengthen the overall HIV patient monitoring system. \\n \\n• Phase 2: implementation of the second phase DQA is in response to identified DQA challenges in the \\nphase 1 DQA which warrant further investigation and review of HIV treatment data in a larger number \\nof ART sites or within the context of implementing a DQA strategy in which DQA activities are scaled \\nup over time. Countries completing the first phase of DQA and finding a verification factor \\n(recreated/reported times 100) of less than 90% or greater than 110% within the sample should \\ntransition to the second phase in which the exercise is expanded to additional ART sites for an overall \\nrepresentation of 80% of the people currently receiving ART for the reporting period being reviewed.'),\n",

This second \\nphase can be conducted by the Ministry of Health and implementing partners with site staff. \\n \\nIn addition, with larger site sample sizes, countries can also consider analyzing and adjusting \\nsubnational ART data based on country need and interest in this phase. \\n \\nDQA Step 1: Set up a multi-stakeholder implementation team  \\nInstitutionalizing routine assessment and monitoring of the quality of reported data is an integral part of an \\neffective HIV program. Data quality is especially important given the use of this data to plan for program \\nimplementation, the use of global resources and to affirm progress towards epidemic control. As such it is \\ncritical there is full ownership and support for DQA from Ministries of Health and partners. Within this context, \\nthe specific roles and responsibilities of country stakeholders are detailed below. \\nBefore starting any data collection or review processes, the Ministry of Health and the country team will inform \\nother national and local authorities, such as the district health office, of this assessment and engage them, \\nseeking their involvement in the data validation activities and other subsequent activities to improve data \\nquality. \\nRoles and responsibilities \\n• Ministries of Health: Ministries of Health are responsible for leading the implementation and overall \\ncoordination of the DQA in collaboration with partners, including PEPFAR, the Global Fund, WHO and \\nUNAIDS. \\n \\n• WHO: WHO will coordinate changes to the guidance on DQA to ensure consistency in implementation \\nacross all partners. In addition, WHO will provide technical support to Ministries of Health for \\nimplementation and convene stakeholders to support the Ministry of Health on using the results and \\ndata and improving the system as necessary. \\n \\n• PEPFAR: PEPFAR headquarters staff will provide technical assistance to interagency country teams \\nfor the development of their specific DQA protocols. In addition, some in-person technical support will \\nbe provided from PEPFAR headquarters staff. \\n \\nPEPFAR field staff from each of the PEPFAR-supported agencies (such as the United States Centers \\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, United States Agency for International Development and \\nDepartment of Defense) are required to participate in planning and implementation of the DQA. \\nPEPFAR field teams should work within the interagency country team to select sites from all ART sites \\nin the country and draft the DQA schedule, draft notification letters to relevant stakeholders and notify \\nimplementing partners and site staff before DQA visits. PEPFAR field staff should also participate in \\ndeveloping the final DQA report and remediation plan and should ensure that implementing partners \\nand sites receive additional technical assistance and remediation, as necessary. Lastly, PEPFAR field \\nstaff should coordinate with Ministries of Health to ensure that divergent numbers identified in \\nPEPFAR-supported sites are corrected in the health ministry reporting system and are reported \\ncorrectly at the next PEPFAR quarterly reporting cycle. \\n \\n• Global Fund: The Technical Advice and Partnerships Department of the Global Fund Secretariat will \\nwork closely with the country teams for respective countries to support the implementation of DQA and \\nthe use of the findings for programs. \\nThe Global Fund will also provide funding and technical assistance for implementing DQA by \\nmobilizing technical resources in the monitoring and evaluation technical assistance pool, local Global \\nFund agents and quality assurance providers for health facility assessments and data quality reviews. \\nThe Global Fund country teams will coordinate with national AIDS programs and in-country partners to \\nensure that the correct national numbers are used for quantifying ARV drugs, laboratory reagents and \\nkey performance indicators.'),\n",

In \\nimplementing the sampling approach, the following steps are followed. \\nI. Create a sampling frame: a list of all ART sites nationally. In the second phase of DQA, countries may \\nconsider disaggregating this list by subnational unit (such as region or district). The sample frame \\nshould include the following information:  \\na. Site name and location, such as province, district, etc.; \\nb. The number of people currently receiving ART in the past calendar year – to validate the \\nprimary indicator of currently receiving ART; \\nc. The number of new ART initiators in the most recent reporting time frame (such as quarter or \\nyear) – to validate the indicator of new ART initiators; \\nd. Domains (such as PEPFAR support, Global Fund support, etc.); and \\ne. Any additional strata of interest (such as facility type, paper versus electronic, etc.). \\nII. Decide on the number of ART sites to be sampled nationally and by strata in phase 1. This is a country \\ndecision usually based on the objectives of the DQA, feasibility, cost and whether the objective is to \\ndevelop a correction factor, achieving an acceptable relative margin of error at the national and \\nsubnational levels and within specific strata of interest. The interorganizational country team should \\ndetermine the appropriate sample size based on country priorities for the specific objectives of the \\nDQA and precision of the desired estimates, available resources, feasibility and time considerations. \\nCountries may assess data quality in a limited sample of sites to obtain understanding of data quality \\nissues to determine whether a correction factor is needed or sites with 80% of the people receiving \\nART should have their numbers of people receiving ART reset. However, a relative margin of error of \\n10% for a 90% confidence interval is recommended as a minimum level of acceptable precision for the \\nnational correction factor for the number of people receiving ART (see subsection 3.5). \\nIII. ART sites should be selected for the assessment by probability sampling, such as simple random \\nsampling, stratified random sampling, systematic random sampling or probability proportional to size \\nsampling, in which size would be based on the number of people facilities reported to be receiving \\ntreatment. To obtain a national correction factor, a qualified statistician should perform the sampling of \\nsites and the country team should archive all the programs and/or tools used to select the sites, \\nspecifically the sampling frame, site selection probabilities and relevant design information, since \\ncertain designs require the use of sampling weights during the analysis phase. \\nIV. Some countries may have sites that are very small (such as fewer than 100 people receiving ART) or \\nmay be difficult to access because of geographical remoteness or political instability. In these cases, \\nthe interorganizational country team may consider excluding some or all of these sites from the \\nevaluation because of logistical considerations. In general, if these sites represent less than 10% of \\nthe population receiving ART in the country, countries may choose to exclude these clinics from the \\nsampling frame.

These sites \\ncan be included in the second phase of DQA. \\n \\nDQA Step 3. Site-level assessment \\nI. Site-assessment: For this activity in both phases 1 and 2, the interorganizational country team uses \\nstandardized processes to review existing information on people receiving ART that is routinely \\ncollected through facility- or community-based patient monitoring systems and site assessment tools. \\nDQA activities use a set of standardized tools and data collection instruments (see the annexes) \\ndeveloped specifically for the treatment indicators, although these may be adapted to fit local contexts \\nor to accommodate additional indicators. Data quality should be assessed at the sites for both \\ntreatment indicators (number of people currently receiving ART and number of people initiating ART) \\ndisaggregated by age and sex. \\n \\nSelected facilities will be contacted to identify a date and time for the DQA visit. Countries may use \\ntheir own template for notifying the sites of the visit and should include the following information: the \\npurpose of the visit, proposed visit dates and a request for key staff to be present for the visit. \\n \\nThe site-level assessment visit will consist, at minimum, of the following activities: \\n• Introductory discussions with key staff of the site and implementing partners; \\n• Review and completion of informed consent; \\n• Review and completion of the patient monitoring system checklist; \\n• Site walk-through and assessment of record systems to determine patient and data flow from \\nthe point of initial data capture (patient files) to data aggregation and reporting (registers and \\nmonthly aggregate tools) and to identify gaps and opportunities to improve data quality; \\n• Recount of reported numbers for selected indicators disaggregated by age and sex and \\ncomparison against the numbers reported to the Ministry of Health routinely as well as \\nPEPFAR, for example in DHIS2 and DATIM (Data for Accountability, Transparency and \\nImpact Monitoring), which may include reviewing paper charts, registers, EMR systems, \\npharmacy records or other record systems; \\n• Cross-validation of a sample of paper charts, registers, EMR systems, pharmacy records or \\nother record systems; depending on the result, a physical count using patient charts should \\nbe conducted if needed; and \\n• Outbrief with key site and implementing partner staff to summarize key findings from the visit.  \\nPast experience with implementing DQA in countries indicates that one site per day on average is \\nfeasible for completing these activities. In terms of human resource, cost and time requirements, this \\nvaries significantly according to the number of facilities sampled and patient files reviewed as well as \\nthe geographical distribution of facilities and country context. As broad guidance, however, a recent \\nexercise implemented in 84 facilities required a team of 31 data collectors and supervisors over 25 \\ndays and 24 data entry clerks over 20 days. \\nII. Data collection and analysis: To assure the quality of collected data for review interorganizational \\ncountry teams are expected to apply standard data quality assurance practices during data collection. \\nThis includes double data entry when possible or having two teams enter a sample of the data to \\ncheck the quality. At the least, data capture will be conducted in pairs with one partner monitoring the \\ndata entry of the other. This will ensure that the data collection team is not introducing any error during \\nthe review process. The process for each activity is outlined below. \\n \\nPrimary activity (required): \\nRecreating selected indicators and validating the report: \\na. Site staff members first describe the site’s data systems, reporting process and methods for \\ncalculating each indicator during the discussions. \\nb. The assessment team calculates the selected indicators according to the current definitions, \\nattempting to replicate the procedures used by each site to aggregate and report quarterly \\ntotals. If sites report the indicator using a definition that differs from the standard definition, this \\nalternative definition will be known as the site definition and will be documented using the site'),\n",

The reporting and site method for the indicator should be used when recreating \\nthe reported number. However, if time and other constraints are present, recreating the \\nstandard definition is the priority activity. \\nc. The recreation of the selected indicators should use the same data source the sites use to \\nreport the indicator. For instance, if the sites use the ART register to report the number of \\npeople currently receiving ART, the recreation should also use the ART register. Some sites \\nmay use the patient charts or other data sources, such as ARV drug pick-up records to report \\non the number of people currently receiving ART. If this is the case, the recreation should be \\nbased on the tools used by the site for reporting. \\nd. This recreation may include computing patient tallies and confirming results from facility \\nregisters, patient databases, pharmacy logs and laboratory records and should review the \\nmost recently reported data. \\ni. When recreating indicators in facilities with an electronic database, and where \\nindicators were calculated by the site using that electronic system, ask the site staff or \\ndatabase manager for the software report or query used to run the calculations, and \\nvalidate the consistency of that query with partner and/or Ministry of Health definitions \\nfor the respective indicator, when possible. Reports are often routine and so definitions \\nand queries used at sites will often be the same across sites using the same electronic \\nsystems. \\nii. A random sample of inactive patient charts (such as 10 charts) should be selected and \\nreviewed to assess misclassification and determine how many may actually still be \\nactive. If this review identifies issues with the classification of inactive patient charts, \\nphysically counting patient charts should be considered (as described in the section on \\nother data validation activities). \\ne. The assessment team then compares the calculated results from the reported and site (if this \\nexists) method recreation with the reported value and discuss differences (if any). The \\nmeasure for comparison will be the verification factor (recreated/reported times 100) and \\nconfidence interval, which explains how much of the reported data can be verified. A \\nverification factor within 90% to 110% is within acceptable levels but should still be recorded, \\nreported and reviewed by the Ministry of Health and country team to adjust national ART data. \\nf. Discrepancies between the reported and recreated values (percentage difference) are \\ncomputed, described and discussed with each site. To the extent possible, the reasons for \\npossible differences between the values computed during the site visit and the values reported \\nby that site are further investigated and described (see other data validation activities for the \\ndetails of methods that can be used). If immediate remediation is needed, action plans should \\nbe developed with the sites and options for correcting the data should be discussed.  \\n \\nTo support the primary data validation activity and implement the final step of assessing the \\ndiscrepancies between reported and recalculated ART numbers, at least one of the data validation \\nactivities below should be conducted alongside the DQA. These activities will inform the DQA by \\nproviding additional information on the completeness and accuracy of the data sources and reporting \\ntools. \\n \\nOther data validation activities: \\n1. Site-level cross-validation: the process of checking the completeness and accuracy of site level \\nsource documents by cross-referencing identified data elements in routine reporting source \\ndocuments (typically patient charts) with other reporting documents, such as the ART register, \\npharmacy records or EMR system. \\na. The assessment team randomly samples a number of patient charts from the ART \\nregister beginning with the start of the time period being reviewed. Assessment teams \\nshould define the number of charts to be selected and the specific sampling method \\n(such as every fifth person) during the planning stages of the assessment.  \\nb.

A random sample of charts may be selected to estimate the completeness and \\naccuracy with a high degree of statistical precision (narrow confidence interval). \\nThis often requires a larger sample size and can be calculated using a sample \\nsize calculator.

The data collected will be used to calculate the percentage of discordance between the \\nsource document (patient charts) and other data from reporting tools such as the \\npharmacy system, EMRs and/or ART register. \\ne. For this activity, teams have access to patient records and charts or personally \\nidentifying health information, and the teams therefore apply a standardized practice to \\ndata extraction, making sure to cover the name, age, address and phone number of \\neach patient. The patient identifiers such as name, date of birth and sex are used to \\nidentify the records for this activity, confirming the same patient across different data \\nsources. These identifiers are not removed from the facility and are not part of the data \\ncollected. The identifiers are destroyed before leaving the health facility. Only \\naggregated data are captured. All data abstraction occurs in a private area, away from \\npatients, and covered (such as closing the folder) if patients are present. \\nf. This activity seeks to determine agreement (and the percentage difference) among \\nreporting tools at the same site, to describe reasons for the discrepancies observed \\nand to make recommendations, if possible, for improvement. \\n \\n2. Physical count using patient charts: in instances where the validity of the indicators produced \\nfrom site-level reporting tools or from cross-validation are of significant concern, the patient files \\ncan be checked and physically counted to confirm the “actual” total of people actively receiving \\nART. Examples of when a physical count might be beneficial include: when source documents \\nused for reporting appear to be significantly incomplete or when there are larger data quality \\nconcerns, such as issues with appropriately accounting for people experiencing interruption in \\ntreatment (IIT) and/or deaths. \\ng.

The number of people actively receiving ART reported may differ from the physical \\nrecount. However, this number should be within acceptable error bounds because of \\nflow in and out of the facility. \\n \\n3. Interruption in treatment (IIT) assessment: in facilities that utilize electronic systems for patient \\nmonitoring and tracking, queries on recent interruptions in treatment can generate a list of \\npatients meeting the IIT criteria. Verification of IIT status in the patient chart can provide an \\nadditional opportunity for validating the accuracy of the electronic system. \\nl. The assessment team works with site staff to query the electronic system to generate a \\nlist of people that have been marked as IIT based on standard definitions. \\nm.

Data management: The data collected and analyzed as part of this assessment will be shared by all \\npartners and the Ministry of Health. These data may be collected using a combination of paper and \\nelectronic forms. Data that are collected on paper forms will be kept in the possession of the field team \\nleads throughout the field exercise. Upon completion of fieldwork, team leads will be responsible for \\ndestroying all personal identifying data forms and transporting all aggregated data back to the main \\noffice. All aggregated data will be entered into an electronic format such as Microsoft Access, Excel or \\nsimilar software. The database used will be password protected and will be available on computers \\nthat are only accessible to the project team.  \\n \\nThe data taken from the site will not include any patient identifiers.

The data collected on paper forms may be kept for up to five years and then destroyed. \\n \\nII. Correction factor to apply to the national numbers of people receiving ART: A key output from \\nthe DQA is a quantitative understanding of the likely level of under- or overreporting of the number of \\npeople receiving treatment nationally during the assessment period. Misreporting of this number can \\narise from the following. \\n \\nIncorrect reporting from the facility and aggregation at the national level. Aggregation of facility level \\nreports to count the number of people receiving treatment at any given time can be subject to error if \\nfacility reports are delayed or missing and not adjusted for or if reports for the facility are entered in \\nduplicate. This type of error can result in either over- or undercounting the actual number of people \\nreceiving treatment. The numbers of people receiving treatment should be corrected to account for \\nmissing facility reports or reports that have been mistakenly entered in duplicate. The desk review in \\nstep 4 assesses this. \\n \\nIncorrect counting of people receiving treatment at the facility level. In addition to simple errors in \\naggregation of data between patient records and reporting forms, incorrect counts of the number of \\npeople receiving treatment may arise from a failure to properly define “currently receiving ART”, from \\nfailure to remove people who have died or disengaged from care or who have transferred facilities or \\nfrom incomplete or backlogged patient records, registers, charts or files. Errors of this type can result \\nin either over- or undercounting the actual number of people receiving treatment at a facility. The \\ncorrect number can be determined by recreating the reported number using patient records and \\nregistries (see subsection 3.3, Step 3: site-level assessment for details). \\n \\nPeople who simultaneously seek care at more than one facility. The number of people receiving \\ntreatment can be incorrectly counted if people are simultaneously registered at and considered to be \\nreceiving treatment by two facilities.  \\n \\nThis error will always result in over-counting the number of people receiving treatment. The correct \\nnumber can be determined by comparing electronic records, where available, across facilities, \\nreviewing possible matches to determine whether they are the same person and then assigning a \\nsingle location for counting purposes. When this comparison can be done with only a subset of the \\npeople receiving treatment, a correction factor could be calculated and applied in addition to the \\ncorrection factor from step i below, if there is agreement that the same level of duplication is occurring \\nin facilities not included in the comparison. If insufficient information is available to determine the \\nunique identity of individuals, this correction factor should not be used.'),\n",

The adjusted ART data also need to be corrected in the national (or subnational) Spectrum \\nestimates file. This will require correcting the historical years as well as the current year.

Central \\nSupport (CS) data has been identified as a data classification, that does not overlap with TA or DSD, which \\ncould fill these gaps and would add to our understanding of an OU's epidemic – highlighting successes and \\nareas needing support. CS data collection is done in conjunction with DSD/TA data collection, to help provide \\nadditional context to services being provided, and the status of the epidemic. In addition to a broader \\nunderstanding of an epidemic, collection of CS data provides insight into services and funding provided \\noutside of the DSD/TA service definitions through support of Host Country governments.  \\n \\nDefinition of Central Support: Centrally supported sites are sites located in areas where PEPFAR is solely \\nproviding financial support at the national, regional or district level,\\u202fwith\\u202fsite-level support through annual visits. \\nThe purpose of this collection activity is to understand further, how close countries are to Epidemic Control, or \\nhow they are maintaining Epidemic Control, with the inclusion of Central Support (CS) data. This chart \\nprovides an example of how the inclusion of CS data can provide a different view of the epidemic at the OU \\nlevel.  \\n \\nAs evidenced in the chart above, Inclusion of CS results allows us to see that this OU is closer to the 95-95-95 \\ngoals than previously evidenced with only DSD/TA data.  \\n \\n \\nData Type vs. Prioritization  \\n• Central Support Data Type: The CS data type, in comparison to the DSD and TA data types, should be \\nreported from sites where PEPFAR is solely providing financial support at the national, regional or \\ndistrict level, and site support is through annual visits. Collection of this data allows for insight into \\nprograms not directly supported (but financially supported) by PEFPAR.  \\n• Central Support Prioritization: Prioritization levels are determined for SNUs during COP planning, based \\non where an SNU sits in reaching 95/95/95 goals. CS prioritization is given when site specific activities \\nhave transitioned to government or other support.7   \\no CS Prioritization does not mean all data should be collected under the CS data classification. \\nSNUs with a CS prioritization currently collect data under DSD, TA, and CS data types. \\no Please review the most recent COP Guidance for further information on the Central Support \\nprioritization.  \\n \\nCentral Support Reporting Requirements  \\n• Indicators: Centrally Supported site-level data should be reported for each of the six required indicators for \\ncentrally supported data: HTS_TST, TX_NEW, TX_CURR, TX_PVLS, PMTCT_STAT, PMTCT_ART \\n• Disaggregates: CS results should be disaggregated at the most complete, and specific level possible. \\nComplete reporting on the age/sex disaggregates that sum to the total numerator is necessary for \\n \\n7 COP/ROP 21 Guidance for All Countries\"),\n",

If reporting on additional disaggregates is not \\nfeasible, please contact SGAC_SI at SGAC_SI@state.gov and copy your PEPFAR Program Manager. \\n• Frequency: CS Indicators should be reported on at least an annual basis. CS Indicators are available for \\nquarterly reporting for OUs with available data. If available, CS indicators should be reported on a \\nquarterly basis. If reporting annually, CS indicators should be summed (except for TX_CURR) so that Q4 \\ndata is equal to the annual cumulative.  \\n• Implementing Mechanisms (IM): \\no Data will not be deduplicated across CS, DSD/TA. Ensure that you are only submitting applicable \\ndata under CS or DSD/TA.   \\no The same IM can be used for DSD/TA data reporting, with the appropriate CS/DSD/TA tab being \\nutilized in the DATIM entry screens.  \\no IMs used for central support are determined on country-by-country basis, and these decisions \\nshould have been made during COP discussions. \\n• Data Entry in DATIM: \\no Required indicators for CS reporting will reflect an option for “CS” reporting where OUs can report \\nsite-level results for centrally supported sites. A snapshot of the tab from the DATIM data entry \\nscreen is provided below. \\n \\n \\n \\nDetails on central support reporting – including the designation of centrally supported SNUs, \\nreporting frequency, and reporting mechanisms - should be decided during COP discussions.

As recommended in the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), Principles \\nand Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System for every death, civil registration systems should collect \\ninformation such as date and cause of death (COD), age, sex and place of residence. \\n \\nAny time activities to reach and reengage patients on treatment are conducted and it is concluded that an ART \\npatient has died, the death should be reported into the formal civil registration system if it is established that \\nthis has not already been done. Where it has been done, in settings where death registration systems are \\nactive, it may be possible to link existing civil registration records of death and COD with ART patient records \\nto ascertain those who have experienced an interruption in treatment (IIT). \\n \\nPEPFAR teams should work collaboratively with their Ministries of Health in conjunction with civil registration \\nauthorities (often located within Ministries of Interior or Home Affairs) to enhance civil registration and vital \\nstatistics systems and to establish consistent procedures for collecting and linking mortality data (i.e., to \\nensure the same data elements are collected for matching purposes). WHO guidance is available to help \\ncountries establish or strengthen civil registration systems. CDC has a team dedicated to strengthening CRVS \\nsystems internationally, within the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is available to provide \\ntechnical assistance.  \\n \\nDeaths among ART patients that occur in the health facility: Deaths occurring within the health facility should \\nbe immediately recorded in the ART register and/other relevant tracking register, which may or may not \\nalready include cause of death. The Medical Certificate of Death and Cause of Death (MCCD) should be filled \\nto ascertain COD and is also a data source for obtaining mortality-related data for patients who died in the \\nfacility. If filled according to WHO/ICD guidelines, and coded correctly, the underlying cause of death (UCOD) \\nwill be identified. When filled correctly, the MCCD will also include a sequence of events leading to the \\nimmediate cause of death. It will also list conditions that are not in the causal chain but are related to the \\ncause of death. If these are entered electronically (through the WHO DHIS mortality module or alternative \\nelectronic system), these fields (Part I, a-d, and Part II) can all be coded and/or searched.  \\n \\nMCCD forms are typically embedded in national death reporting forms, which include demographic information \\nand other country-specific requirements for registration. Completed death reporting forms should be sent to \\nthe national registration authorities for legal registration. Even without COD, recording and reporting all deaths \\namong HIV-infected patients, and the general population, as well as knowing mortality rates, etc., is valuable. \\n \\nDeaths among ART patients that occur outside the health facility: Deaths that occur outside the facility should \\nbe confirmed by unambiguous report of family or close acquaintance (i.e., it should not be presumed). COD in \\ncommunity settings is commonly ascertained through verbal autopsy. Verbal autopsy is a method of gathering \\nhealth-information about a patient that has died in order to determine their probable COD; it typically includes \\nan interview with a caregiver to elicit known diagnoses, signs, and symptoms experienced by the deceased as \\nwell as an open narrative describing the circumstances of the death. Where a system for verbal autopsy is in \\nplace, PEPFAR teams should coordinate with local authorities to identify the best COD information available \\n(e.g., reported conditions, open narrative, probable COD assigned).  Where such a system is not in place, \\nverbal autopsy could be introduced or, for purposes of this indicator, unvalidated family reporting can be \\naccepted to determine cause of death. For more information on verbal autopsy, see the WHO verbal autopsy \\nstandards.  \\n \\nCaveats: \\nIt is widely acknowledged that even where reporting is required, mortality data, especially cause of death, are \\noften underreported or inaccurate. Where high quality MCCD is available, PEPFAR teams can expect to find \\nUCOD according to the standard definitions provided. However, where systems are weak, teams may need to \\nuse whatever COD information is available for reference to best describe conditions co-existing at the time of \\ndeath. For verbal autopsy, it should also be noted that since verbal autopsy results are generally considered \\nvalid only at the population level, teams are likely to be able to elicit information about conditions coexisting at \\nthe time of death rather than a specific UCOD. For reference, the National Center for Health Statistics at CDC'),\n",
